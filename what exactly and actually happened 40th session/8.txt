The engine initialization looks fine. Now let me think about what's really happening. Looking at the current game from the problem statement:

The game shows that **the bot played Na7+ at move 17** which is a very strange move. Let me look at the v40 functions to see if there's an issue with the evaluation logic. The critical issue seems to be that despite having all these evaluation functions, the bot is still making blunders.

Let me check the syntax validity of the current file:
Action: $ node -c "/app/Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" 2>&1 | head -10
Observation: Exit code: 0
