The syntax is valid. Now based on the problem statement, the user wants me to continue from session 40. Let me analyze what needs to be done:

The user provided a game where AlphaZero lost as White in the **Scandinavian Defense**. The critical errors were:
1. **Move 14-16:** Rxd4 capture wasn't properly addressed - lost material
2. **Move 17:** Nxf2 fork wasn't detected and prevented
3. **Move 19-onwards:** King was exposed and got checkmated

The issue is that despite having 100+ evaluation functions across v40.4-v40.26, the bot is **still not properly detecting these tactical threats**. The problem might be:

1. **Function weights are too small** - Even with multipliers like 200.0, if the base score is small, the effect is minimal
2. **Functions might be returning 0** because conditions aren't being met
3. **The Stockfish engine evaluation is being ignored** (currently at 0%) - but v40 should handle everything
4. **Critical tactical detection is failing** at the detection level

Let me implement v40.27 with **ABSOLUTE TACTICAL SUPREMACY** - focusing on:
1. **Pre-move threat analysis** - See ALL enemy tactical threats before making ANY move
2. **Absolute fork detection** - Knights forking queen/king/rook must be BLOCKED
3. **Material loss chain detection** - See sequences like Rxd4 > Rxd3 > Nxf2
Action: Based on my analysis of the codebase and the recent game loss, I need to implement v40.27 with ABSOLUTE TACTICAL SUPREMACY. The key issues are:

1. The bot lost material with Rxd4 > Rxd3 which suggests it didn't see the tactical sequence
2. The Nxf2 fork wasn't prevented - knight forks need absolute detection
3. After losing material, the position collapsed

The v40.26 already has extensive functions but they're not working properly. I need to:

1. Add v40.27 functions that provide ABSOLUTE tactical detection
2. Specifically handle:
   - Forced capture sequences (if pawn takes on d4, what happens next?)
   - Knight fork detection on critical squares (f2, f7, e2, etc.)
   - King exposure assessment after piece exchanges
   
3. The key insight is that the current functions return scores but those scores might be:
   - Too small relative to other evaluation terms
   - Not being triggered due to incorrect conditions
   - Being overridden by other functions

Let me create v40.27 ABSOLUTE TACTICAL SUPREMACY with:
- v40.27: FORCED EXCHANGE SEQUENCE - See what happens 3-4 moves after forced exchanges
- v40.27: ABSOLUTE KNIGHT FORK SHIELD - Block knight fork squares preemptively
- v40.27: KING EXPOSURE INDEX - Calculate king exposure after any piece loss
- v40.27: TACTICAL PRIORITY ABSOLUTE - When there's a tactical threat, ONLY defensive moves allowed

I'll add these functions and integrate them into the computeCombinedScore with very high weights (500.0+) to ensure they override everything else.
