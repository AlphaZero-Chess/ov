Session 25 Summary - Continuing from Session 24

WHAT WAS DONE:
1. Reviewed sessions 1-24 to understand what had been implemented
2. Found that v40.14 CONFIG was added but functions were NOT implemented
3. Implemented the v40.14 ABSOLUTE ZERO BLUNDER SUPREME functions:

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED (lines 13099-13490):
- v40LookAheadBlunderCheck() - THE MOST CRITICAL: Simulates opponent's best response
  - For EVERY move, simulate making it
  - Find ALL possible opponent captures
  - If opponent can capture FREE = CATASTROPHIC penalty
  - Specifically detects cases like Bd3 where exd3 captures bishop

- findPawnAttacksOnSquare() - Helper to find pawns attacking a square
  - Returns array of squares where attacking pawns are located
  - Used to detect cases like Bd3 being attacked by e4 pawn

- findAllCaptures() - Helper to find ALL possible captures for a color
  - Returns array of {from, to, piece} for each capture
  - Used in look-ahead simulation

- getPossibleMovesForPiece() - Helper to get all possible moves for any piece
  - Handles pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king movements
  - Returns array of target squares

- v40TripleCheckBlunderVerification() - Run blunder check 3 times
  - Multiple passes to ensure NO TACTICAL OVERSIGHTS
  - All passes must agree move is safe

- v40FailSafeBlunderCheck() - FINAL safety check before committing
  - Returns {isBlunder: bool, score: number, reason: string}
  - If blunder detected, move is REJECTED

CONFIG VALUES ADDED (lines 1540-1574):
- v40LookAheadBlunderCheckEnabled: true
- v40LookAheadDepth: 2
- v40OpponentCapturesPenalty: -5000000
- v40OpponentCapturesQueenPenalty: -10000000
- v40OpponentCapturesRookPenalty: -4000000
- v40OpponentCapturesMinorPenalty: -2500000
- v40OpponentCapturesPawnPenalty: -1000000
- v40PieceOnPawnAttackedSquarePenalty: -8000000
- v40BishopKnightPawnCaptureAwareness: true
- v40VerifyAllCapturesEnabled: true
- v40AnyFreeCaptureAvailablePenalty: -6000000
- v40TripleCheckEnabled: true
- v40TripleCheckPasses: 3
- v40TripleCheckConsensusRequired: true
- v40FailSafeBlunderRejectionEnabled: true
- v40BlunderScoreThreshold: -1000000
- v40AbsoluteZeroBlunderDominance: 1.0

INTEGRATION (lines 28803-28885):
- Added v40.14 function calls with HIGH multipliers:
  - lookAheadBlunderScore * 10.0
  - tripleCheckScore * 5.0
  - failSafeScore * 10.0
- Added to v40DeepScore calculation
- Added debug logging for all v40.14 scores

FILE STATUS:
- Header updated to v40.14 ABSOLUTE ZERO BLUNDER SUPREME
- File size: 31,458 lines
- Syntax check: PASSED (node --check)

THE KEY FIX:
The main problem was: Bot played Bd3 where exd3 captures the bishop.
The v40LookAheadBlunderCheck function now:
1. Simulates making the move
2. Finds ALL possible opponent captures
3. Checks if opponent can capture the piece we just moved (or any piece)
4. If yes and undefended, returns MASSIVE penalty (-8,000,000)
5. findPawnAttacksOnSquare specifically checks for pawn attacks

This should PREVENT blunders like Bd3 where the piece lands on a pawn-attacked square.
