
Action: Based on my analysis of both session files and the current state of the codebase, here's what I've learned:

1. **Session 1** - The v40 CONFIG was added with parameters for:
   - TRUE Persistent MCTS (10000 simulations, PUCT selection, Dirichlet noise)
   - Value/Policy Network Emulation
   - Extended Strategic Horizon (200+ moves)
   - Zero Blunder System (12 verification passes)
   - Flawless Endgame (Philidor, Lucena, Opposition, Triangulation, Zugzwang)
   - Resilience & Counterplay
   - Web-Weaving (Multi-Front Pressure)
   - Pattern Recognition
   - Initiative & Tempo
   - Predictive Outcome Modeling

2. **Session 2** - Implementation work:
   - V40MCTSNode class was added
   - v40TrueAlphaZeroMCTS function implemented
   - v40ValueNetworkEmulation implemented
   - v40SuperhumanBeastEvaluate implemented
   - Integration into computeCombinedScore
   - Helper functions were enhanced (Philidor, Lucena, triangulation, zugzwang, etc.)

The file is about 20,098 lines now. The v40 system is implemented but needs:
1. Better integration points - ensure v40 is being called in the main flow
2. More robust endgame techniques (the stubs were enhanced but could be better)
3. Better blunder detection with actual deep tactical scanning
4. The true MCTS tree needs to actually persist and be used properly

Key areas to enhance now:
1. Update header to v40 to reflect the new version
2. Enhance the blunder verification with deeper tactical analysis
3. Improve endgame techniques with actual Philidor/Lucena pattern detection
4. Better web-weaving with real multi-front pressure calculation
5. Ensure the persistent MCTS tree is properly reused between moves
6. Add proper legal move generation for tree expansion
7. Enhance the value network emulation with more sophisticated evaluation

The user wants:
- TRUE AlphaZero replica
- Crush Stockfish
- Flawless endgame play
- Perfect positional judgment
- Zero blunders
- 20+ move deep blunder prediction
- 30+ move planning
- Uncanny web-weaving
- Delayed gratification

I should implement substantial improvements to make this a "superhuman beast" rather than "mediocrity".
