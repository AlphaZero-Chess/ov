Now I need to add an even more fundamental fix. The real problem is that the bot needs to **SIMULATE OPPONENT'S BEST RESPONSE** after making a move. The current functions check if OUR piece lands on an attacked square, but they don't properly account for:

1. After we move, opponent responds with the BEST move
2. That opponent's response might capture our piece

Let me implement v40.14 with LOOK-AHEAD BLUNDER PREVENTION:
