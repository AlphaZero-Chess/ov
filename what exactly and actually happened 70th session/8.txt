The syntax is valid. Now let me analyze the games the user provided in the problem statement and implement the critical fixes. The issue is clear from the games:

1. **Game Analysis**: All games show the bot losing, typically getting checkmated
2. **Key Issues**:
   - Bot plays passive openings (Leonardis Variation: 1.e4 e5 2.d3)
   - Fails to detect forcing sequences leading to mate
   - Doesn't recapture properly
   - Misses tactical shots

Let me create v40.50 improvements focusing on the specific patterns seen in the lost games:
Action: $ cd /app && grep -n "v40.49\|ABSOLUTE RECAPTURE" "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | head -20
