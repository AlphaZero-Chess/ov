
Action: Based on my analysis of the codebase and session history:

CURRENT STATE:
- Version: v40.49 ABSOLUTE RECAPTURE
- Lines: 48,283
- Many sessions of enhancement have been done (sessions 1-68)
- We are now at the 69th session

RECENT GAMES ALL LOST:
Looking at the recent game losses provided by the user:
1. All games show the bot (AlphaZero) losing to Lichess AI level 8
2. Common patterns:
   - Opening passivity (d3 moves, Leonardis Variation)
   - Tactical oversights leading to mate
   - Failed to recapture properly
   - Failed to detect mating nets early
   - Queen shuffling and passive piece play

KEY ISSUES STILL PRESENT:
1. The bot keeps playing the Leonardis Variation (1.e4 e5 2.d3) which is passive
2. Failing to see tactical sequences
3. Getting checkmated in many positions
4. Not generating counterplay

The problem statement mentions that the 69th session is ongoing and I need to continue the plans.

Looking at file 17-20 of the 69th session, it shows:
- The filter for d2d3 exists but the bot still plays d3
- The calculateMove function flow

WHAT I NEED TO DO:
Based on all sessions, the user wants me to continue enhancing the bot to make it a TRUE AlphaZero replica that:
1. Doesn't play passive opening moves like d3
2. Detects mating threats earlier
3. Generates counterplay
4. Has deeper strategic planning
5. Perfect endgame technique

The 69th session was looking at why the bot still plays d3 despite the filter. I need to check if the filter is actually working and if not, fix it. Then add more enhancements for the tactical oversights.

Let me view the current state of the computeCombinedScore function and see what needs to be updated, then implement v40.50 improvements.
