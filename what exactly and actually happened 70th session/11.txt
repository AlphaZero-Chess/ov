Now let me find where to add v40.50 functions. I'll add new critical evaluation functions:
Action: $ cd /app && grep -n "v40.49.*function\|function v40.49\|// v40.49:" "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | tail -10
Observation: 45980:                // v40.49: CRITICAL FIX - Generate capture move ourselves if Stockfish didn't suggest it!
Exit code: 0
