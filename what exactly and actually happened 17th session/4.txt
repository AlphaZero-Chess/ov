Good - `lastOpponentMove` is being tracked. But I need to check where it's initialized and if it's being passed correctly. Let me check the current state of the file more thoroughly and then implement v40.7 improvements:
Action: $ cd /app && wc -l "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" && node -c "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" 2>&1 || echo "Syntax check failed"
Observation: 26020 Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js
Exit code: 0
