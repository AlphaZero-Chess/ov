Good - the v40.6 functions exist. Now let me analyze the new game from the problem statement to understand what's still failing:
Action: Analyzing the new game from the problem statement:

[White "AlphaZero"]
[Black "lichess AI level 8"]
[Result "0-1"]
[ECO "B02"]
[Opening "Alekhine Defense: Normal Variation"]

1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 { B02 Alekhine Defense: Normal Variation } 
3. Nf3 c5 
4. d4 cxd4 
5. Nc3 dxc3 (Black wins a knight on c3!)
6. Qd4 e6 
7. Bd3 Nc6 
8. Qe4 cxb2 (Black captures b2 pawn, now has passed pawn on b!)
9. Bxb2 Qb6 
10. Bc1 Bb4+ 
11. Bd2 Bxd2+ 
12. Kd1 Bc3 (Black pieces infiltrate)
13. Qh4 Bxa1 (Black wins rook!)
14. Bc4 Qb1+ 
15. Ke2 Nc3+ 
16. Ke3 Qxh1 (Black wins the other rook!)
17. Ng1 Qxg1 
18. Kf4 Qxg2 (Total material carnage)
19. Ke3 g5 
20. Qh6 Qe4+ 
21. Kd2 Qf4+ 
22. Kd3 Nxe5# { Black wins by checkmate. }

KEY PROBLEMS:
1. Move 5: Nc3 is terrible - the d4 pawn was hanging! After cxd4, White played Nc3 without recapturing, then Black played dxc3 winning a KNIGHT FOR FREE!
   - This is a CENTER PAWN TENSION issue - White ignored the hanging d4 pawn
   - v40PawnTensionResolution should have penalized Nc3 when d4 was captured

2. Move 8: cxb2 - Another pawn grab that White allowed
   - The c3 pawn (from dxc3) was a huge problem that created passed pawn

3. Move 13-17: Material hemorrhage - lost both rooks and game
   - King safety collapsed completely
   - No pieces were coordinating for defense

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
The main issue is Move 4-5: After Black played cxd4, White MUST recapture (Nxd4, Qxd4, exd4 etc). Instead:
- White played Nc3 (development over tactics)
- Black captured dxc3 winning the knight!

This shows the v40.6 PAWN TENSION RESOLUTION and CENTER PAWN PROTECTION functions are either:
1. Not working properly
2. Not weighted heavily enough
3. Not being called at all (bug)

The bot is still prioritizing "development" (Nc3) over immediate tactical requirements (recapturing on d4). This is EXACTLY what v40.6 was supposed to fix!

NEXT STEPS:
1. Check if v40.6 functions are integrated properly
2. Verify the weights are high enough
3. Add additional tactical awareness:
   - After opponent captures center pawn, IMMEDIATELY recapture
   - Any move that doesn't address immediate tactical threat = huge penalty
   - Track "must recapture" state

Session 17 Plan:
1. Increase weights of v40.6 functions dramatically
2. Add v40.7 "ABSOLUTE TACTICAL PRIORITY" - when material is being lost, OVERRIDE everything
3. Implement "recapture urgency" - when pawn taken, recapture gets massive bonus
4. Add "piece loss detection" - detect when pieces will be lost for free
5. Check if lastOpponentMove is being passed correctly to the functions
