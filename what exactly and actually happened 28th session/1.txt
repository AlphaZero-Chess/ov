
Action: Looking at the session history and current state:

1. The file is currently at v40.16 (32,785 lines)
2. v40.16 CONFIG values were added (file opening toward king, pawn storm detection, queen infiltration path, 3-ply deep look-ahead, kingside pawn shelter, forcing line rejection)
3. Several v40.16 functions were added (v40FileOpeningTowardKingEval, v40PawnStormDetectionEval, v40QueenInfiltrationPathEval, v40DeepLookAheadEval, canQueenReachSquare helper)
4. The function calls were integrated into the main evaluation
5. Debug logging was added

BUT I need to verify:
1. Are ALL the v40.16 functions complete?
2. Are missing functions: v40KingsidePawnShelterEval, v40ForcingLineRejectionEval?
3. Are there any syntax errors?

Let me check if the missing functions exist...
