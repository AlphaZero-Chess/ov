The functions look good. Now let me check the current state of the file fully and ensure everything is in order:
Action: $ cd /app && node --check "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" 2>&1 && echo "SYNTAX OK" && wc -l "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js"
Observation: SYNTAX OK
32786 Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js
Exit code: 0
