Now let me update the weighted merge comment:
Action: file_editor str_replace /app/Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js --old-str "        // v40.4: TRUE ALPHAZERO GODLIKE weighted merge — v40 GODLIKE DOMINANT (80%)

        const combinedScore = (
            TRUE_ALPHAZERO.qWeight * engine_Q * 0.20 +  // Engine reduced to 20%
            TRUE_ALPHAZERO.rolloutWeight * rollout_Q * 0.20 +

        );" --new-str "        // v40.5: TRUE ALPHAZERO TRANSCENDENT weighted merge — v40 TRANSCENDENT DOMINANT (85%)

        const combinedScore = (
            TRUE_ALPHAZERO.qWeight * engine_Q * 0.15 +  // Engine reduced to 15%
            TRUE_ALPHAZERO.rolloutWeight * rollout_Q * 0.15 +
