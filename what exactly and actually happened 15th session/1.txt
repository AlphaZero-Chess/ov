
Action: Based on my comprehensive review of all sessions (1-13), I now understand the state of the codebase:

CURRENT STATE:
- v40.4 GODLIKE EDITION
- 25,075 lines
- Syntax valid
- 80% v40 dominance
- 100K MCTS simulations in config
- Stockfish initialization fix implemented in session 13

NEW GAME ANALYSIS (from problem statement):
[White "AlphaZero"]
[Black "lichess AI level 8"]
[Result "0-1"]
[ECO "B00"]
[Opening "Nimzowitsch Defense: Scandinavian Variation"]

1. e4 Nc6 2. d4 d5 (Nimzowitsch Defense)
3. Nf3 dxe4 (White loses center pawn)
4. Ne5 Qxd4 (Black takes the d-pawn!)
5. Bf4 Qxb2 (Queen steals b2 pawn - DISASTER!)
6. Nxc6 bxc6 (Knight took knight, but queen is active)
7. Nd2 e5 (e5! closing center)
8. Be3 f5 (f5 attack!)
9. Rb1 Qc3 (Queen infiltrates to c3)
10. Rb3 Qa5 (Queen escapes)
11. c3 f4 (f4! attacking bishop)
12. Nxe4 fxe3 (Takes on e4, now e3 weakness)
13. fxe3 Be6 (Bishop develops)
14. Bd3 Bxb3 (Wins exchange on b3!)
15. Qxb3 Qd5 (Queen centralized)
16. O-O Qxb3 (Queens trade, White is worse)
17. a3 Be7 (Development continues)
18. Ba6 Qb6 (Queen attacks a6)
19. Bd3 Qxe3+ (Wins e3 pawn with check!)
20. Nf2 Bxa3 (Wins a3 pawn!)
21. Bb5 cxb5 (Takes bishop!)
22. h3 Bc5 (Piece activity)
23. c4 bxc4 (Takes c-pawn)
24. Rd1 Qxf2+ (Takes knight with check!)
25. Kh2 Qf4+ (Check!)
26. Kh1 c3 (Passed pawn!)
27. Rd5 Qf1+ (Check!)
28. Kh2 Bg1+ (Bishop check!)
29. Kh1 Bf2+ (Another check!)
30. Kh2 Qg1# (CHECKMATE)

KEY ISSUES:
1. Move 4: Ne5 hung the d-pawn! Should have protected d4 first (c3 or Nc3)
2. Move 5: Bf4 allowed Qxb2 - QUEEN RAID on b2!
3. Overall: Opening disaster - lost pawns on d4, b2, material hemorrhage
4. The bot allowed systematic queen raids and didn't see immediate threats

ISSUES TO ADDRESS FOR v40.5:
1. QUEEN RAID DETECTION - Prevent Qxd4, Qxb2 type raids
2. HANGING PAWN DETECTION - Ne5 hung the d-pawn!
3. CENTER CONTROL - Lost center control early
4. PIECE COORDINATION - Pieces weren't coordinated to defend
5. IMMEDIATE THREAT DETECTION - Didn't see dxe4 left d4 hanging

SESSION 14 PLAN:
1. Analyze why the existing functions didn't catch these issues
2. Implement v40.5 enhancements:
   - v40QueenRaidDetection - Detects queen raids on weak pawns
   - v40HangingPawnPenalty - Enhanced hanging pawn detection
   - v40CenterControlEnforcement - Stronger center control
   - v40ImmediateThreatDetection - Better immediate threat spotting
3. Increase weights on key functions
4. Test and validate

The game shows that even with v40.4's improvements, the bot is still making fundamental opening blunders - losing material through simple tactics. The priority should be:
1. Tactical awareness (hanging pieces/pawns)
2. Queen activity threats
3. Center control

Let me start implementing v40.5 enhancements.
