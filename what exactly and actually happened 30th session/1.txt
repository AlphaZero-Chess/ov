Good, the codebase is quite comprehensive. Let me now analyze the specific game to see why the bot still lost and implement v40.20 improvements:
Action: Game Analysis from problem statement (most recent game):
[White "AlphaZero"]
[Black "lichess AI level 8"]

1. e4 e5 2. d3 Nc6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 d5 5. Be2 Be7 6. exd5 Nxd5 7. O-O O-O 
8. d4 exd4 9. Nxd4 Nxc3 10. bxc3 Ne5 11. Rb1 h6 12. Nf3 Ng6 
13. Be3 b6 14. Nd4 c5 15. Nc6 Qc7 16. Nxe7+ Qxe7 17. a3 Rd8 
18. Qc1 Nh4 19. Bd3 c4 20. f3 cxd3 21. g3 dxc2 22. gxh4 cxb1=R 
23. Bg5 Qc5+ 24. Qe3 hxg5 25. c4 Qxe3+ 26. Kh1 Rxf1+ 27. Kg2 Qxf3# 

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Move 18 (Qc1) - TERRIBLE. Passive queen move going backwards
2. Move 19 (Bd3) - Putting bishop on a square where c4 threatens it
3. Move 20 (f3) - Weakening the kingside when under tactical pressure
4. Move 21 (g3) - DISASTER - allowing dxc2 and subsequent pawn promotion!
5. Move 22 (gxh4) - Takes knight but allows cxb1=R - PROMOTION!

The bot COMPLETELY MISSED:
1. The c4-cxd3-dxc2-cxb1=R promotion sequence
2. The forcing nature of Black's attack
3. The kingside weakness created by f3 and g3

ROOT CAUSE: The bot doesn't see PAWN PROMOTION SEQUENCES far enough ahead. It needs to calculate ALL forcing sequences to their conclusion, especially those involving passed pawns and promotions.

v40.20 REQUIREMENTS:
1. PAWN PROMOTION THREAT DETECTION - Calculate promotion lines 6+ moves ahead
2. PASSED PAWN CREATION PENALTY - Heavy penalty when opponent creates passed pawn
3. FORCING SEQUENCE CALCULATOR - Must calculate ALL forcing moves to conclusion
4. KING WEAKENING ABSOLUTE PENALTY - Never play f3/g3 when under attack
5. ABSOLUTE TACTICAL CALCULATION - See dxc2 type sequences
