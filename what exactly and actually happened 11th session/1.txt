
Action: I now have a complete understanding of what was implemented:

SESSION SUMMARY:
- Sessions 1-4: Initial v40 structure and basic functions
- Session 5: v40.1 - Basic integration
- Session 6: v40.2 - Prophylactic, rook infiltration, king safety corridors, 65% dominance
- Session 7: v40.3 started - Anti-passivity, deep horizon, space domination, 75% dominance
- Session 8: Continued v40.3 - Enhanced weights, counterattack, initiative preservation
- Session 9: Completed v40.3
- Current state: v40.4 with 75% dominance, 100K MCTS simulations in header but need to verify

Now for session 10, the user mentioned:
"We are NOW at the 10th session and continue your plans 'eg "Now let me add the new v40.4 functions. First, let me find a good location to add them"

Looking at the NEW game that was provided (second test game):
[White "AlphaZero"]
[Black "lichess AI level 8"]
- King's Pawn Game: Leonardis Variation
- White played passively (2. d3 instead of d4!)
- Lost queen to knight tactic (Nxg3+ winning exchange)
- Got mated with Qxg2#

KEY ISSUES FROM THIS GAME:
1. Opening played passively (d3 instead of d4)
2. Didn't see the knight tactic (Nf5 attacking g3)
3. Knight invasion penalty not working
4. Got mated on g2

The v40.4 header mentions:
- "Discovered Attack Detection" 
- "Knight Invasion Penalties"
- "Opening Principles"
- "Enhanced Queen Mating Patterns"
- "Pawn Shield Integrity"

These are the NEW functions I need to implement for v40.4!

Let me implement:
1. v40OpeningPrinciplesEvaluation - Penalize passive openings like 2.d3
2. v40DiscoveredAttackDetection - Enhanced detection
3. v40KnightInvasionPenalty - Penalize allowing knight forks
4. v40EnhancedQueenMatingPatterns - Better queen mate detection
5. v40PawnShieldIntegrity - Better pawn shield evaluation

And integrate them into computeCombinedScore with appropriate weights.

Also need to upgrade to 80% v40 dominance as mentioned in header!
