The rules look correct. The issue might be that the filter is not being applied in all code paths. Let me check where `selectAlphaZeroMove` is called and if the filter is actually being executed:
Action: $ grep -n "selectAlphaZeroMove\|calculateMove" "/app/Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | head -20
Observation: 41537:    // Immediately call calculateMove
41538:    setTimeout(() => calculateMove(), 100);
46886:    debugLog("[SCHEDULE]", `✅ All checks passed for ${colorName}, proceeding to calculateMove()`);
46891:    calculateMove();
47230:function calculateMove() {
47258:        setTimeout(() => calculateMove(), Math.random() * 500 + 200);
47541:                calculateMove();
Exit code: 0
