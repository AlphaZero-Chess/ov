I see the flow now. The engine sends back the best move, and then it goes through the selectAlphaZeroMove function which applies the filters. Let me find where the engine result is processed:
Action: $ grep -n "selectAlphaZeroMove" "/app/Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | head -10
Observation: Exit code: 0
