Now I understand the current state. The 68th session implemented v40.48 with:
1. Ultimate recapture fix for central pawns
2. Anti-blunder protection for pieces moving to pawn-attacked squares
3. Must capture hanging enemy pieces rule

However, looking at the recent games, the bot is still losing. Let me analyze the most recent game from the problem statement more carefully:
Action: Looking at the most recent games from the problem statement:

Game 1 (Lost as White - Sicilian Defense: Closed, Traditional):
1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 g6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Ne2...

Here after 4...cxd4, the bot should play 5. Nxd4 (recapturing the central pawn). But it played 5. Ne2 instead!

This means the v40.48 fix for central pawn recapture is NOT WORKING. Let me analyze why:

The filter at line 45737-45758 checks:
- CONFIG.v40MustRecaptureModeEnabled && moveCount <= 15
- Looks for enemy pawn on d4/e4 (for white)
- If found and we can capture, rejects any move that doesn't capture

But the issue might be:
1. CONFIG.v40MustRecaptureModeEnabled might be false
2. The moveCount might be wrong
3. The canPieceCapture function might have a bug
4. The filterBoard might not be parsed correctly

Actually, looking at the game more closely:
- After 4...cxd4, it's white's move 5
- moveCount would be around 9 (5 white moves)
- The pawn is on d4
- Knight on f3 can capture d4

The v40.48 code at line 45904-45939 should:
1. Detect enemy pawn on d4
2. Check if we can capture it
3. Force a capture move

Let me check if there's a bug in the canPieceCapture function or if the alternatives array doesn't include Nxd4.

Actually, I think I found the issue. Looking at line 45929:
```javascript
const captureMovesAll = alternatives.filter(alt => alt.move.substring(2, 4) === mustRecaptureCentralSq);
```

This filters moves where the DESTINATION is the central square. For Nf3xd4, the move would be "f3d4", so substring(2,4) = "d4" which should match.

BUT - the issue might be that Stockfish's `alternatives` array might not contain f3d4 at all! Stockfish might think Ne2 is better and not include Nxd4 in the top alternatives.

The fix should be:
1. If we MUST recapture, generate ALL legal capture moves ourselves
2. Don't rely on Stockfish's alternatives array
3. Force the capture move even if Stockfish doesn't suggest it

Let me implement this fix now.
