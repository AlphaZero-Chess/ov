I see the issue! Looking at the game:
```
1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. d3
```

After moves 1-2, the board state is:
- White pawn on e4 (moved from e2)
- White knight on c3
- Black pawn on c5
- Black pawn on d6

On move 3, the bot plays `d2d3`. The function checks:
- `fromSquare = 'd2'` ✓
- `toSquare = 'd3'` ✓  
- `pieceType = 'p'` ✓ (pawn is on d2)
- `isWhite = true` ✓
- `board.get('d4')` = null (d4 is empty) ✓

So the penalty SHOULD apply! The issue must be one of:
1. `CONFIG.v40AbsoluteOpeningProhibitionEnabled` is false
2. The score is being overwhelmed

Let me check the config and then also check if there's a bug in how scores get combined:
Action: $ cd /app && grep -n "v40AbsoluteOpeningProhibitionEnabled" "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | head -5
Observation: 2167:    v40AbsoluteOpeningProhibitionEnabled: true,
24128:    if (!CONFIG.v40AbsoluteOpeningProhibitionEnabled) return 0;
Exit code: 0
