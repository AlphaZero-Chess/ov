The `simulateMoveOnBoard` function exists. Now let me analyze the most recent game from the user to understand what needs to be improved. The most recent game shows:

```
[White "AlphaZero"]
[Black "lichess AI level 8"]
[Opening "Sicilian Defense: Closed"]
1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. d3 Nf6 4. Nf3 e5...
```

The bot played **d3** on move 3 despite all the prohibitions! Let me check the issue:
Action: $ cd /app && node -c "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" 2>&1 | head -20
Observation: Exit code: 0
