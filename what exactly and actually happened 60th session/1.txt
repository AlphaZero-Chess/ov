Session 59 implemented v40.39 with pawn capture chain detection. The code is already in place. Now let me analyze the most recent game from the problem statement to understand what needs to be fixed:
Action: ANALYSIS OF THE LATEST GAME from user's problem statement:

[White "AlphaZero"]
[Black "lichess AI level 8"]
1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Bb5 g6 5. d4 cxd4 6. e5 dxc3 7. exf6 cxb2 
8. Bxb2 Qa5+ 9. Kf1 Qxb5+ 10. c4 Qxb2 11. fxe7 Bg7 12. Rc1 Qxa2 13. Qd6 Bb2 
14. Kg1 Bxc1 15. Qd5 Ba3 16. Nd2 Qa1+ 17. Nf1 Bxe7 18. Qf3 Qc1 19. Qd3 d6 
20. Qd2 Qxd2 21. Nxd2 Be6 22. c5 dxc5 23. f3 O-O-O 24. Nf1 Rd1 25. Kf2 b5 
26. Ke3 Nd4 27. g3 Re1+ 28. Kd3 c4+ 29. Kc3 b4+ 30. Kxd4 Rd8# 0-1

CRITICAL ISSUES (playing as White):

1. Move 5: d4 was fine, but after 5...cxd4, White should recapture!
   
2. Move 6: After 5...cxd4, White played 6.e5 INSTEAD OF RECAPTURING!
   - The pawn on d4 attacks Nc3
   - e5 ignores this threat completely
   - This is a PAWN CAPTURE RESPONSE FAILURE
   
3. Move 7: After 6...dxc3 (pawn takes knight!), White played 7.exf6
   - Now c3 pawn attacks bishop Bb5 AND threatens cxb2 (promotion!)
   - White lost a whole knight!
   - exf6 ignores the devastating pawn chain threat

4. Move 7-8: cxb2 then Bxb2 - Black promotes to attack, gets massive material advantage

The problem is that v40.39 may have the functions but they're not working correctly.

Let me check if the v40.39 functions are properly integrated and if there are any bugs.

Current state: The file has v40.39 implemented with:
- v40PawnCaptureChainEval
- v40PieceUnderPawnAttackEval  
- v40PromotionThreatEval
- v40RecaptureChainEval
- v40PieceUnderPawnDangerEval
- v40PawnForkDetectionEval

But based on the game loss, these functions are STILL NOT WORKING properly!

The issues:
1. After cxd4, the bot didn't see that d4 pawn attacks Nc3 - MUST RECAPTURE
2. After dxc3, the bot didn't see that c3 pawn attacks Bb5 AND threatens b2 promotion

I need to implement v40.40 with EVEN STRONGER enforcement:
1. MANDATORY RECAPTURE - When opponent takes pawn near our piece, MUST recapture or move piece
2. PAWN ADVANCE TOWARD PROMOTION - If pawn can advance toward promotion, block it
3. PIECE ATTACKED BY PAWN - If our piece is attacked by enemy pawn, MUST respond
4. MULTI-THREAT PAWN - If pawn attacks AND threatens something else, HIGHEST priority

The key insight: The bot needs to understand that after cxd4, the d4 pawn now THREATENS Nc3. And after dxc3, the c3 pawn THREATENS Bb5 AND b2. These aren't "chains" - they're IMMEDIATE THREATS that must be addressed!

Let me create v40.40 with ABSOLUTE MANDATORY RECAPTURE and IMMEDIATE PAWN THREAT RESPONSE.
