Action: Let me analyze the MOST RECENT game from the user's problem statement:

```
[White "AlphaZero"]
[Black "lichess AI level 8"]
[Result "0-1"]
[ECO "B23"]
[Opening "Sicilian Defense: Closed"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. d3 Nf6 4. Nf3 e5 5. Qd2 Be6 6. Be2 Nc6 7. Qd1 h6 8. Be3 Nd4 9. O-O Be7 10. Nd2 O-O 11. Re1 Qb6 12. Rb1 Qc6 13. b3 b5 14. Bf3 b4 15. Na4 Rac8 16. c3 Nxf3+ 17. Qxf3 Ng4 18.

KEY ISSUES I SEE:

1. **MOVE 3: d3??** - The bot STILL played d3 in the Sicilian Defense! After 1.e4 c5 2.Nc3, the bot should play 2.Nf3 or 3.d4 (Open Sicilian), NOT d3!

2. **MOVE 5: Qd2??** - Queen development before completing minor piece development. This is a waste of tempo.

3. **MOVE 7: Qd1??** - Queen RETREAT! Going back to d1 after just moving to d2. MASSIVE tempo loss.

4. **MOVE 16: Nxf3+** - The bot allowed a knight fork/exchange that lost material.

5. **MOVE 24: Re4?? Bxd2** - The bot lost the knight on d2.

6. Overall: The bot played the Closed Sicilian (d3 system) which is considered passive. The d3 prohibition should have kicked in but didn't!

THE ROOT PROBLEM:
Despite all the v40.31-40.33 improvements with "ABSOLUTE d3 PROHIBITION", the bot is STILL playing d3! This means either:
1. The hard filter isn't being applied correctly
2. The opening book still has d3 moves
3. The engine is overriding the filter

For the 50th session, I need to:
1. Verify the d3 prohibition is ACTUALLY working
2. Remove ALL d3 moves from opening book for Sicilian positions
3. Enhance the Sicilian handling to force d4 or f4 attacks
4. Add Queen retreat prohibition (Qd2-Qd1 pattern)
5. Enhance tactical detection to prevent Nxf3+ patterns

The user's frustration is clear - the bot is "echoing nothing but mediocrity" because it keeps playing passive d3 systems and wasting tempo with queen shuffling. I need to implement TRUE aggressive AlphaZero play.
