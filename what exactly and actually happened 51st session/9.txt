I can see the code is extensive. Let me check where the v40.33 functions should be integrated:
Action: $ grep -n "v40DeepScore =" "/app/Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | tail -5
Observation: 40465:        let v40DeepScore = 0;
41052:                v40DeepScore = v40Score + v40MatingNetPenalty + v40FileControlBonus +
Exit code: 0
