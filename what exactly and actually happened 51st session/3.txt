I can see v40.33 has extensive d3 prohibition. Let me check why it's still not working - let me look at the actual game flow and verify the functions are being called:
Action: $ grep -n "v40AbsoluteD3ProhibitionEval\|v40SicilianMasteryEval" "/app/Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | head -20
Observation: 25055:function v40AbsoluteD3ProhibitionEval(fen, move, board, activeColor, moveNumber) {
25109:function v40SicilianMasteryEval(fen, move, board, activeColor, moveNumber) {
Exit code: 0
