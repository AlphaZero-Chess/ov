
Action: Based on my analysis of the session files (1-8) and the current codebase:

CURRENT STATE:
- Version: 40.3.0-SUPERHUMAN-BEAST-ULTIMATE
- File has 23,377 lines
- Key functions exist:
  - v40AntiPassivityEvaluation (line 4862)
  - v40DeepHorizonEvaluation (line 5166)
  - v40SpaceDominationEvaluation (line 5859)
- Integration is in place at line ~20893 in computeCombinedScore

FROM THE 8TH SESSION:
- The v40.3 upgrades were started but not completed
- The weights were updated to 75% v40 dominance
- Anti-passivity, deep horizon, space domination were added to the integration
- MCTS simulations increased from 10K to 50K (in config)
- But the session ended mid-implementation

WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE:
1. ✅ v40.3 CONFIG - Already has 50K simulations, antipassivity, deephorizon enabled
2. ✅ v40AntiPassivityEvaluation function - Already exists
3. ✅ v40DeepHorizonEvaluation function - Already exists
4. ✅ v40SpaceDominationEvaluation function - Already exists
5. Need to verify these functions are being called properly
6. Need to check if integration is at 75% as intended
7. Need to enhance the functions to be more effective based on game analysis

Let me verify the current integration and then enhance the Space Domination function as mentioned in the 8th session plan.

Key areas to focus:
1. Space Domination Enhancement - Make it track true territorial control
2. Verify 75% v40 dominance is properly set
3. Enhance counterattack priority
4. Improve mating pattern detection

The game analysis shows the bot lost due to:
- Passive play (Qd1-Qd3-Qe4-Qd3 shuffling)
- c-file invasion not prevented
- Ra1# mating pattern not detected early enough
- No counterplay generation when behind

I need to enhance the functions to address these specific weaknesses.
