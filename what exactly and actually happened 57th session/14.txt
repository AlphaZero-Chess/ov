I can see that v40.36 is integrated but v40.37 scores are calculated but NOT added to v40DeepScore summation. Let me fix this by adding the v40.37 scores to the v40DeepScore calculation:
Action: file_editor str_replace /app/Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js --old-str "                               // v40.36 QUEEN CAPTURE PROHIBITION & CASTLING DIRECTION SUPREME additions!
                               queenCaptureProhibitionScore + knightSacrificePreventionScore + castlingDirectionScore +
                               exchangeQualityVerificationScore + pieceActivityRequirementScore;
                v40Bonus = v40DeepScore * 1.0;  // 100% influence — v40.36 QUEEN CAPTURE & CASTLING PARADIGM SHIFT" --new-str "                               // v40.36 QUEEN CAPTURE PROHIBITION & CASTLING DIRECTION SUPREME additions!
                               queenCaptureProhibitionScore + knightSacrificePreventionScore + castlingDirectionScore +
                               exchangeQualityVerificationScore + pieceActivityRequirementScore +
                               // v40.37 ROOK PASSIVE & KING CORNER RETREAT SUPREME additions!
                               rookPassiveProhibitionScore + kingCornerRetreatScore + desperationSacrificeScore +
                               ultraQueenCaptureScore + passiveUnderAttackScore;
                v40Bonus = v40DeepScore * 1.0;  // 100% influence — v40.37 ROOK PASSIVE & KING CORNER PARADIGM SHIFT"
