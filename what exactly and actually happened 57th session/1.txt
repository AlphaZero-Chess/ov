
Action: Based on my review of sessions 5-8, I can see:

1. The project is a Lichess bot userscript trying to replicate AlphaZero
2. Multiple versions have been implemented (v40.0 through v40.35+)
3. The bot keeps losing games to Lichess AI level 8 
4. Key issues identified in games:
   - Passive play, lack of initiative
   - Queen shuffling patterns
   - File control blindness
   - Mating net vulnerability  
   - Poor endgame technique

5. Session 55 mentioned "no actual implementation occurred yet" in the 56th session context

Now I need to:
1. Read the most recent sessions (say 50th onwards) to understand where we left off
2. View the current state of the userscript
3. Continue implementing improvements

The user mentioned we're at 56th session continuing from 55th which had no implementation. Let me check the most recent session files to understand the current state.
