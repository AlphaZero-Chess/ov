
Action: Based on my analysis of the session files and the current codebase:

CURRENT STATE (v40.2):
- File has ~22,090 lines of code
- v40.2 is implemented with 65% v40 dominance
- Includes prophylactic evaluation, rook infiltration detection, king safety corridors
- Has 12-pass blunder verification system
- Has persistent MCTS with PUCT selection

GAME ANALYSIS - WHY THE BOT LOST:
The game shows critical failures:
1. AlphaZero (white) lost to Lichess AI level 8 by checkmate
2. The c-file invasion wasn't stopped (Rc8, Rxc3)
3. King trapped at a2-a3 area allowing Ra1#
4. Passive play - not enough counterplay generation
5. Queen shuffling (Qd3-Qe4-Qd4-Qb6 pattern) without creating threats
6. Complete endgame collapse

USER'S FEEDBACK:
- "echoing nothing but mediocrity"
- "knockoff toy than the real deal"
- Need to implement TRUE persistent MCTS with deep search
- Moves that "look odd initially but pay off later"
- Prioritize "deep understanding over brute-force"
- Need 20+ move deep prediction for blunders
- 30+ move strategic planning
- "Uncanny web-weaving ability"

WHAT NEEDS TO BE ENHANCED for v40.3:
1. **DEEPER MCTS Simulations** - Increase from 10,000 to 50,000+ simulations
2. **30+ Move Horizon Planning** - Currently 200+ is claimed but not truly implemented
3. **STRONGER Evaluation Weights** - Current weights still allow mediocre play
4. **ENHANCED Mating Net Detection** - The Ra1# pattern wasn't detected
5. **BETTER Counterplay Generation** - The bot played passively
6. **STRONGER File Control** - c-file invasion wasn't prevented
7. **IMPROVED Initiative Tracking** - Lost initiative early and never regained
8. **TRUE Web-Weaving** - Multi-front pressure wasn't applied

Key areas to implement/enhance:
1. v40.3 Deep Lookahead Evaluation (30+ move planning)
2. v40.3 Horizon Effect Prevention
3. v40.3 Stronger MCTS Integration
4. v40.3 Anti-Passivity System
5. v40.3 Enhanced Mating Pattern Library
6. v40.3 True Web-Weaving with Multi-Front Pressure
7. v40.3 Initiative Conservation System
8. v40.3 Counter-Attack Priority System

Let me view more of the current implementation to understand what specific enhancements are needed.
