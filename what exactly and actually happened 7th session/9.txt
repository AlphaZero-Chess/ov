Now I have a comprehensive understanding. Let me create an enhancement plan:
Action: COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS COMPLETE:

The current v40.2 implementation has:
1. V40MCTSNode class with PUCT selection (lines ~1417-1687)
2. v40TrueAlphaZeroMCTS function (line 1699) - 10,000 simulations
3. v40SuperhumanBeastEvaluate function (line 2325) with 13 phases
4. 12-pass blunder verification (v40MultiPassBlunderCheck)
5. Integration at 65% weight in computeCombinedScore (line 19583)
6. Prophylactic evaluation, rook infiltration detection, king safety corridors (added in 6th session)

CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX FOR v40.3:
1. **MCTS Simulations too low** - 10,000 simulations is still weak for true AlphaZero level. Need 50,000+
2. **No true 30+ move lookahead** - The horizon is set but not implemented properly
3. **Passive play not penalized enough** - Lost game showed passive Qd1-Qd3-Qe4 shuffling
4. **File control still weak** - c-file invasion wasn't prevented
5. **Anti-passivity system missing** - Need to force active play
6. **Deeper mating net detection** - Ra1# pattern wasn't caught early enough
7. **Better counterplay generation** - When defending, need more active counterplay

NEW FEATURES FOR v40.3 "PARADIGM SHIFT ULTIMATE":
1. v40.3 Anti-Passivity System - Penalize moves that don't improve position
2. v40.3 Deep Horizon Evaluation (true 30+ move planning)
3. v40.3 Mating Pattern Library Enhancement (includes corner patterns)
4. v40.3 Counterattack Priority System
5. v40.3 Space Advantage Tracking
6. v40.3 Increase simulations to 50,000
7. v40.3 Stronger evaluation weights (increase v40 influence to 75%)
8. v40.3 Better piece activity evaluation
9. v40.3 Opening/middlegame initiative preservation
10. v40.3 Multi-Front Web-Weaving Enhancement

Let me implement these enhancements now.
