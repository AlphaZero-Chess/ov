Now let me integrate the v40.6 functions into the computeCombinedScore function. First let me find the exact location:
Action: $ cd /app && grep -n "queenInfiltrationScore + hangingPieceScore" "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js"
Observation: 23404:                               queenInfiltrationScore + hangingPieceScore + kingCornerScore + checkSequenceScore;
Exit code: 0
