Now let me find a good location to add v40.6 functions. First let me find where the v40.5 functions end:
Action: $ cd /app && grep -n "v40.5: Helper\|// v40.5:" "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | tail -20
Observation: 1160:    // v40.5: CHECK SEQUENCE DETECTION — Prevent forcing sequences leading to mate
1165:    // v40.5: ENHANCED 85% DOMINANCE — Make v40 even more dominant
6957:// v40.5: CRITICAL TACTICAL BLINDSPOT FIXES
7061: * v40.5: Helper - Check if queen can attack a square
7187: * v40.5: Helper - Check if square is attacked by a color
7212: * v40.5: Helper - Can piece attack square
7247: * v40.5: Helper - Check path is clear for sliding pieces
7267: * v40.5: Helper - Get lowest attacker value
7293: * v40.5: Helper - Get simple piece value
7308: * v40.5: Helper - Get squares defended by a piece
7431: * v40.5: Helper - Get queen checking squares around king
7454: * v40.5: Helper - Can queen reach square (v40 version)
7476: * v40.5: Helper - Get king escape squares
7593: * v40.5: Helper - Get potential checking squares for a piece type
22493:                // v40.5: QUEEN INFILTRATION DETECTION — Prevent Qxb2 type disasters
22496:                // v40.5: ENHANCED HANGING PIECE DETECTION — Prevent material losses
22499:                // v40.5: KING CORNER SAFETY — Prevent h1/h2 mate traps
22502:                // v40.5: CHECK SEQUENCE DETECTION — Prevent forcing sequences leading to mate
22505:                // v40.5: COMBINED v40 SCORE — 85% TRANSCENDENT DOMINANT INFLUENCE
22552:        // v40.5: TRUE ALPHAZERO TRANSCENDENT weighted merge — v40 TRANSCENDENT DOMINANT (85%)
