The syntax is valid. Now let me analyze the game from the problem statement to understand what went wrong and what needs to be improved. Let me view key areas of the current implementation:
Action: Based on my analysis of the codebase and session history:

CURRENT STATE:
- v40.5 TRANSCENDENT Edition with 25,099 lines
- 85% v40 dominance in move selection  
- v40.5 functions implemented: QueenInfiltration, HangingPiece, KingCorner, CheckSequence
- Syntax valid

NEW GAME ANALYSIS (from problem statement):
[White "AlphaZero"] [Black "lichess AI level 8"] Result: 0-1
Opening: Nimzowitsch Defense: Scandinavian Variation

Critical Blunders:
1. Move 3: dxe4 - Black wins center pawn
2. Move 4: Ne5 instead of protecting d4 - This hung the d-pawn!
3. Move 5: Bf4 which allowed Qxd4 and then Qxb2 - QUEEN RAID!
4. Throughout: AlphaZero lost material systematically 

KEY ISSUES TO ADDRESS FOR v40.6:
1. CENTER PAWN PROTECTION - The bot must detect when center pawns are under attack and protect them
2. PAWN TENSION HANDLING - When dxe4 was played, the bot should have recaptured or protected d4
3. QUEEN RAID PREVENTION - The bot allowed Qxd4 and Qxb2 - devastating queen raids
4. DEVELOPMENT vs TACTICS PRIORITY - Ne5 was developing but tactically wrong
5. PIECE COORDINATION - Pieces weren't coordinated to defend weak points

The bot is failing at basic tactical awareness - specifically:
- Not seeing that Ne5 left d4 hanging
- Not preventing queen raids on b2/d4
- Not recapturing immediately when pawns are taken

This is a case where the bot's "deep positional" thinking is overriding basic tactical requirements. The v40.5 functions exist but the weights or detection thresholds might be insufficient.

PLAN FOR 15th SESSION CONTINUATION:
1. First check if the v40.5 functions properly detect these patterns
2. Increase weights for tactical functions
3. Add new v40.6 enhancements:
   - v40PawnTensionResolution - Force recapture of center pawns
   - v40QueenRaidPrevention - Enhanced queen raid detection
   - v40CenterPawnProtection - Prioritize center pawn safety
   - v40BasicTacticalPriority - Override positional eval when tactics demand

Let me implement these improvements.
