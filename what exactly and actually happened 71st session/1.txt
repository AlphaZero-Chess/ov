
Action: Based on my analysis of the session history and the current state:

Current Version: v40.50 (was updated in session 70)
Lines: 48,283
Status: Syntax is valid (node -c passes)

From the problem statement, the user wants me to continue from session 70/71. The key issues I can see:

1. The bot is still losing all games to Lichess AI level 8
2. Recent games show:
   - Passive opening play (Leonardis Variation with d3)
   - Getting checkmated quickly
   - Missing tactical threats
   - Not recapturing properly

The user says session 70 was working on improvements but no actual implementation occurred yet in the previous session. Session 71 is where I need to continue.

Looking at the most recent game from session 70:
```
[White "AlphaZero"]
[Black "lichess AI level 8"]
[Result "0-1"]
1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 g6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Ne2 e5...
```

The bot played 5. Ne2 instead of 5. Nxd4! This is a clear bug - the recapture system isn't working.

Key enhancements needed (from the problem statement):
1. AlphaZero-Inspired MCTS Architecture - TRUE persistent tree search
2. Extended Strategic Horizon - 30+ move planning
3. Improved Positional Evaluation - material, mobility, king safety, pawn structure
4. Enhanced Tactical Verification - multiple scans for blunders
5. Advanced Endgame Techniques - opposition, triangulation, zugzwang
6. Resilience Features - counterplay, fortress, swindles

I need to implement significant improvements. Let me:
1. First check if the v40GenerateCaptureMove function exists and works
2. Add v40.50 enhancements for deep forcing line detection
3. Improve the tactical verification system
4. Fix the opening book to prevent passive play

Let me focus on the MOST CRITICAL issues first:
- The recapture system (Ne2 instead of Nxd4 bug)
- Checkmate detection (bot getting mated quickly)
- Opening enforcement (stop playing d3)
