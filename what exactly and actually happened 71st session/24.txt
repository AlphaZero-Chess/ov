Now let me add another critical fix - the bot is still getting checkmated frequently. I need to add a mate threat detection that runs BEFORE any move is sent. Let me look at the sendMove function:
Action: $ grep -n "function sendMove" "/app/Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js"
Observation: 47560:function sendMove(move, retryCount = 0) {
Exit code: 0
