Now I see it clearly. The book move at line 47338 gets selected and sent directly without passing through the hard move filter. And the applyAlphaZeroLogic function at line 47980 also has early returns that bypass the filter.

This is the root cause! The Ne2 move was probably coming from the opening book or being selected before the filter could reject it.

The fix is to ensure that:
1. The book move is checked against the recapture filter
2. The hard filter runs BEFORE any move is selected

Let me implement v40.50 with these critical fixes:

47342|        const thinkTime = Math.random() * 900 + 500;
47343|        
47344|        debugLog("[ENGINE]", `📖 Book move: ${bookMove} (${(thinkTime/1000).toFixed(1)}s)`);
47345|
