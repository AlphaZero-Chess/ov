Now let me find where the v40.24 functions end and add the v40.25 functions:
Action: $ grep -n "v40.24 Helper" "/app/Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | tail -3
Observation: 19374: * v40.24 Helper: Is path clear between two squares?
19394: * v40.24 Helper: Get all knight moves from a square
19419: * v40.24 Helper: Does move defend the queen?
Exit code: 0
