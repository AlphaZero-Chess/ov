
Action: Based on my analysis of all the session files and the latest game provided by the user:

CURRENT STATE:
- The bot is at v40.24 with "ABSOLUTE QUEEN SAFETY SUPREME" implemented
- Previous sessions implemented many features: anti-passivity, deep horizon, mating pattern detection, etc.
- The latest game shows the bot STILL losing despite all these implementations

CRITICAL ISSUES IN THIS GAME:
1. Queen trade too early (Qxb6) - gave up initiative
2. Terrible pawn structure after exchange (weak d3 pawn)
3. Complete positional collapse - no counterplay
4. Losing a piece (Nxf3+ Nxd2) - tactics missed
5. Pawn race lost completely (b2 vs c6)
6. King trapped in corner - mating attack

THE ROOT PROBLEMS:
1. The bot still doesn't TRULY evaluate positions deeply
2. The v40 implementation is not being used DOMINANTLY enough
3. The weights in computeCombinedScore are still at 65%, not the claimed 75%
4. Anti-passivity system exists but didn't prevent the passive play (Qxb6 trade)
5. Endgame technique failed (pawn race calculation)
6. No escape route planning for the king

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN SESSION 36:
1. Increase v40 dominance to 85% (engine only 15%)
2. Add ABSOLUTE RECAPTURE SYSTEM - when piece is captured, MUST recapture if possible
3. Add NO QUEEN TRADE EARLY - prohibit early queen trades that give up initiative
4. Add PAWN RACE CALCULATION - precise calculation of pawn races
5. Add KING ESCAPE ROUTE - ensure king always has escape squares
6. Add STRONGER POSITIONAL COLLAPSE DETECTION - detect when position is collapsing
7. Enhance counterplay generation - never let opponent squeeze without response

Let me implement v40.25 with these critical fixes.
