The code is extensive with many v40.x additions. Let me check what the latest game analysis tells us and implement improvements. Based on the game:

```
1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 Bf5 4. Nf3 e6 5. Nc3 Ne7 6. Bd3 Bxd3 7. cxd3 Nf5 8. O-O Nd7 
9. Qb3 Qb6 10. Qxb6 Nxb6 <-- EARLY QUEEN TRADE - GAVE UP INITIATIVE!
...
24. g3 Nxf3+ 25. Kg2 Nxd2 <-- LOST A PIECE (Knight took Bishop on d2)
...
38. c6 b2 39. c7 Kd7 40. c8=Q+ Kxc8 41. Kg2 b1=Q+ 42. Kh3 Qf1# <-- PAWN RACE LOST
```

The main issues are:
1. **Early Queen Trade** - Qxb6 gave up all initiative in a closed position
2. **Piece Loss** - Didn't see Nxf3+ Nxd2 fork
3. **Pawn Race Lost** - b2 queened faster than c7

Let me implement v40.25 to fix these:
Action: $ grep -n "v40.24:" "/app/Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | head -5
Observation: 1874:    // v40.24: ABSOLUTE QUEEN SAFETY SUPREME
1880:    // v40.24: QUEEN UNDER ATTACK DETECTION — NEVER ignore queen being attacked!
1890:    // v40.24: MUST DEFEND QUEEN — If queen attacked, the move MUST defend it!
1898:    // v40.24: KNIGHT FORK DETECTION — Knights are deadly against queens!
1904:    // v40.24: PRE-MOVE QUEEN SAFETY CHECK — Check queen safety BEFORE every move
Exit code: 0
