Now let me update the combined score calculation:
Action: file_editor str_replace /app/Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js --old-str "        // v40.1: TRUE ALPHAZERO weighted merge — v40 DOMINANT (55%)
        // Engine provides baseline, but v40 superhuman evaluation is PRIMARY
        const combinedScore = (
            TRUE_ALPHAZERO.qWeight * engine_Q * 0.45 +  // Engine reduced to 45%
            TRUE_ALPHAZERO.rolloutWeight * rollout_Q * 0.45 +
            normalizedPolicyPrior * 0.8 + // Policy bonus slightly reduced
            v40Bonus                      // v40 DOMINANT at 55%
        );" --new-str "        // v40.2: TRUE ALPHAZERO weighted merge — v40 ABSOLUTE DOMINANT (65%)
        // Engine provides baseline, but v40 superhuman evaluation is ABSOLUTE PRIMARY
        const combinedScore = (
            TRUE_ALPHAZERO.qWeight * engine_Q * 0.35 +  // Engine reduced to 35%
            TRUE_ALPHAZERO.rolloutWeight * rollout_Q * 0.35 +
            normalizedPolicyPrior * 0.6 + // Policy bonus reduced
            v40Bonus                      // v40 ABSOLUTE DOMINANT at 65%
        );"
