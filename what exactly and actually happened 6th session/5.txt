The v40.1 integration is already in place with 55% dominance. Now let me analyze the game that was lost and identify the critical issues. Let me think about what additional enhancements are needed to prevent this specific game loss:
Action: GAME ANALYSIS - AlphaZero (White) vs Lichess AI Level 8 (Black):

Key moves and failures:
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Qxd4 - Queen out early!
5. Qd3 - Queen retreating after Nc6 threat
6. Nc3 Be7 7. e5 Ng4 - Black attacks with knight
8. Qe4 f5 - Queen pushed around
9. Qd3 Ngxe5 - Queen retreating AGAIN (3rd queen move)
10. Nxe5 Nxe5 11. Qe2 - 4th queen move!

The bot made at least 4 queen moves in the first 11 moves - this is exactly the disaster the v40QueenMovementPenalty function should prevent!

Then later:
- Black invaded with Rc8, Rxc3, Rc2 - the c-file invasion
- White's king got cornered at a2
- Rook mate pattern: Ra2-Ra1#

THE CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. The v40 evaluation functions EXIST but may not be strong enough
2. The queen penalty exists but wasn't preventing the moves
3. The mating net detection exists but didn't see Ra1#

What needs to be enhanced:
1. INCREASE the weights of the new evaluation functions
2. Make the queen movement penalty STRONGER (multiply by higher factor)
3. Make the mating net detection more aggressive
4. Ensure the v40 functions are actually being called during evaluation

Looking at the code:
- v40MatingNetPenalty = ... * 0.5 (halving the penalty!)
- v40FileControlBonus = ... * 0.3 (only 30%)
- v40InitiativeBonus = ... * 0.4 (only 40%)
- queenPenalty is unscaled (good)

The scaling factors are too small. The penalties need to be MUCH higher to actually influence move selection.

Current state: v40 has 55% influence, but the individual components are scaled down too much.

PLAN FOR TRUE ALPHAZERO ENHANCEMENT:
1. Increase the penalty multipliers (0.5 -> 1.0, 0.3 -> 0.6, 0.4 -> 0.8)
2. Add NEW functionality for:
   - 20+ move deep tactical vision
   - Better rook infiltration detection
   - King safety corridor evaluation
   - Endgame transition detection
3. Enhance the existing functions with stronger penalties
4. Add PROPHYLACTIC move bonus (preventing opponent's plans)

Let me implement these enhancements to make the bot truly superhuman.
