SESSION 34 SUMMARY - v40.23 INTEGRATION COMPLETE

The file was already at v40.23 with the header updated and functions implemented from session 33.
However, the v40.23 functions were NOT integrated into the main evaluation scoring system.

WHAT WAS DONE IN SESSION 34:

1. VERIFIED v40.23 Header (already done in session 33):
   - Name: Lichess Bot - TRUE ALPHAZERO v40.23 ROOK LIFT & QUEEN MATING ATTACK SUPREME
   - Version: 40.23.0-ROOK-LIFT-MATING-SUPREME

2. VERIFIED v40.23 CONFIG parameters exist (lines 1835-1870):
   - v40RookLiftEnabled: true
   - v40RookLiftToHFilePenalty: -1500000000
   - v40QueenHFileEnabled: true
   - v40QueenOnHFilePenalty: -1800000000
   - v40F3G3ProhibitionEnabled: true
   - v40F3MoveProhibitionPenalty: -3000000000
   - v40MatingAttackEnabled: true
   - v40KingsideFortressEnabled: true

3. VERIFIED v40.23 Functions exist (lines 17875-18282):
   - v40RookLiftDetectionEval() - Detects rook lift patterns (Rf5-Rh5)
   - v40QueenHFileInvasionEval() - Detects queen h-file invasions (Qh4-Qxh2#)
   - v40F3G3ProhibitionEval() - PROHIBITS f3/g3 moves when under attack
   - v40MatingAttackPatternEval() - Recognizes mating attack patterns
   - v40KingsideFortressEval() - Evaluates kingside fortress integrity

4. ADDED v40.23 Function Calls (line 34168-34180):
   - const rookLiftScore = v40RookLiftDetectionEval(...) * 70.0
   - const queenHFileScore = v40QueenHFileInvasionEval(...) * 75.0
   - const f3g3ProhibitionScore = v40F3G3ProhibitionEval(...) * 80.0
   - const matingAttackPatternScore = v40MatingAttackPatternEval(...) * 65.0
   - const kingsideFortressScore = v40KingsideFortressEval(...) * 60.0

5. INTEGRATED v40.23 Scores into v40DeepScore (line 34235):
   - Added: rookLiftScore + queenHFileScore + f3g3ProhibitionScore + matingAttackPatternScore + kingsideFortressScore

6. ADDED Debug Logging (lines 34294-34298):
   - RookLift, QueenHFile, F3G3Prohibition, MatingAttackPattern, KingsideFortress logs

7. UPDATED Debug Header (line 34240):
   - Changed from "v40.22 KNIGHT INFILTRATION" to "v40.23 ROOK LIFT & QUEEN MATING ATTACK SUPREME"

VERIFICATION:
- File syntax validated: node -c "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" - EXIT CODE 0
- File line count: 36,871 lines

KEY FIXES FOR THE GAME PATTERN:
The latest game showed:
- Bot played f3 (CATASTROPHIC kingside weakness)
- Missed Rf5-Rh5 rook lift pattern
- Missed Qe7-Qh4-Qxh2# queen mating attack

Now with v40.23:
- f3g3ProhibitionScore (80x weight) will HEAVILY penalize f3 moves
- rookLiftScore (70x weight) will detect rook lifts to h-file
- queenHFileScore (75x weight) will detect queen h-file invasions
- These patterns should now be detected and prevented!
