The file is syntactically valid with 47,249 lines. Now let me analyze the most recent game from the problem statement to understand what still needs to be fixed:
Action: ANALYSIS OF THE MOST RECENT GAME FROM PROBLEM STATEMENT:

[White "AlphaZero"]
[Black "lichess AI level 8"]
1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Bb5 g6 5. d4 cxd4 6. e5 dxc3 7. exf6 cxb2 
8. Bxb2 Qa5+ 9. Kf1 Qxb5+ 10. c4 Qxb2 11. fxe7 Bg7 12. Rc1 Qxa2 13. Qd6 Bb2 
14. Kg1 Bxc1 15. Qd5 Ba3 16. Nd2 Qa1+ 17. Nf1 Bxe7 18. Qf3 Qc1 19. Qd3 d6 
20. Qd2 Qxd2 21. Nxd2 Be6 22. c5 dxc5 23. f3 O-O-O 24. Nf1 Rd1 25. Kf2 b5 
26. Ke3 Nd4 27. g3 Re1+ 28. Kd3 c4+ 29. Kc3 b4+ 30. Kxd4 Rd8# 0-1

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Move 6: After 5...cxd4, White played 6.e5 - the d4 pawn attacks Nc3!
   - White should have played 6.Nxd4 to recapture
   
2. Move 7: After 6...dxc3, White played 7.exf6 - the c3 pawn attacks Bb5 AND threatens cxb2!
   - White should have saved the bishop or played Bxc6

The bot has a FUNDAMENTAL problem: it doesn't see pawn attack chains properly. Despite having v40.40 and v40.41 functions for this, the bot still ignores pieces under pawn attack.

The core issue is the evaluation functions may be returning huge penalties, but the ENGINE SCORE might be overriding them. Or the functions aren't detecting the threats properly.

Looking at session 61, it says "no actual implementation occurred yet" - meaning the v40.41 PRE-MOVE functions might have been defined but not integrated, or there's a bug.

Let me check:
1. Are v40.41 functions properly defined?
2. Are v40.41 functions integrated into computeCombinedScore?
3. Is the penalty being applied correctly?

I need to:
1. View the v40.41 function definitions
2. View the computeCombinedScore integration
3. If not integrated, add the integration
4. Test for syntax validity

The session history shows this has been a 60+ session project and the bot still loses. The issue might be:
1. Functions exist but aren't called
2. Functions are called but return wrong values
3. Weights aren't high enough
4. The engine score dominates despite penalties

For v40.42, I should:
1. Verify v40.41 integration
2. Add even more robust PRE-MOVE threat detection
3. Make the penalties truly ABSOLUTE (return -Infinity equivalent)
4. Add explicit "ONLY VALID MOVES" filtering before engine even sees moves
