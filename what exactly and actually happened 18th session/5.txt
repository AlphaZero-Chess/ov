The syntax is valid. Now let me analyze the latest game that failed and understand what needs to be improved:
Action: Looking at the latest game the user provided:

KEY ISSUES I SEE:

1. Move 2: d3 - This is a passive/defensive move. The King's Pawn Game: Leonardis Variation is not aggressive. The bot should play d4 or develop more actively.

2. Move 9: Nxd5 Qxd5 - This exchange trades a developed knight and brings Black's queen to an active central square. Bad exchange.

3. Move 11: Qc1 - Very passive queen placement. The queen doesn't belong on c1 this early.

4. Move 12-15: Ng5? then c3? - The knight goes to g5 and then after complications, the bot trades pieces and creates weaknesses.

5. Move 22-30: Complete collapse - Rf1, Rfb1, etc. are passive defensive moves while Black's attack crashes through.

The bot is playing VERY PASSIVELY and making poor exchanges. The current v40 improvements focus on tactical blunders, but the real issue is:

1. **Strategic passivity** - d3 instead of d4, Qc1 instead of an active queen move
2. **Poor piece exchanges** - Nxd5 giving Black central queen
3. **Lack of counterplay** - When under attack, the bot doesn't fight back
4. **Positional collapse** - Pieces end up on bad squares

What needs to be added for v40.8:
1. **ANTI-PASSIVITY BOOST** - Strengthen the anti-passivity function
2. **EXCHANGE QUALITY** - Don't trade pieces that help the opponent
3. **QUEEN ACTIVITY** - Keep queen active, not passive
4. **CENTRAL CONTROL** - Prioritize d4/e4/d5/e5 control
5. **COUNTERPLAY GENERATION** - When under attack, create counter threats

Let me check the current computeCombinedScore integration and enhance the anti-passivity and exchange quality evaluations.
