
Action: Based on the session history files I've read (particularly session 17), here's what I understand:

1. The bot is currently at v40.7 with many functions implemented
2. The user tested the bot and it lost again with the new game showing:
   - King's Pawn Game: Leonardis Variation
   - The bot still lost to lichess AI level 8
   
The latest game analysis shows:
[White "AlphaZero"]
[Black "lichess AI level 8"]

Key issues I see:
1. Move 9: Nxd5 trades a knight when there's no reason to
2. The position degenerated and the bot lost all pieces

The session 17 notes show v40.7 functions were added for:
- Recapture Urgency
- Piece on Attacked Square Detection
- Material Hemorrhage Detection
- Absolute Blunder Check

Now I need to continue the implementation from where session 17 left off. Let me check if there are any missing v40.7 helper functions that need to be added.

The key issue from the game is that the bot is still making fundamental tactical errors - letting pieces hang, making poor exchanges, not seeing simple tactics.

I should:
1. Check if v40.7 helper functions are complete
2. Verify the functions are properly integrated
3. Maybe add v40.8 improvements based on the latest game analysis

Let me check the current state of the helper functions.
