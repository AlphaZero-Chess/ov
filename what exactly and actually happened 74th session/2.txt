Now I understand the current state. The file is at v40.51 and the user wants me to add the v40.51 enhancement functions. Let me check what was planned in the 73rd session by looking at the last mentioned functions:
Action: $ cd /app && grep -n "v40.50\|v40.49\|v40.48" "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | head -30
Observation: 28877: * v40.49 CRITICAL: Generate a capture move for a target square
45862:            // v40.48: DON'T MOVE PIECES TO SQUARES WHERE THEY GET CAPTURED FOR FREE
45891:            // v40.48: MUST CAPTURE HANGING ENEMY PIECE
45947:        // v40.48 ULTIMATE RECAPTURE FIX: ALWAYS prioritize central pawn captures
45980:                // v40.49: CRITICAL FIX - Generate capture move ourselves if Stockfish didn't suggest it!
Exit code: 0
