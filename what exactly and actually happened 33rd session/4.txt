v40.22 functions exist and are integrated. Now let me check if the header needs updating and analyze what's still needed. Based on the most recent game analysis, I need to implement v40.23 for:
1. ROOK LIFT DETECTION (Rf5-Rh5 pattern)
2. QUEEN MATING SQUARE DETECTION (Qh4-Qxh2# pattern)
3. EXTREME KINGSIDE WEAKNESS DETECTION (f3 move was catastrophic)
Action: $ cd /app && grep -n "v40.22" "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | grep -i "header\|name\|version" | head -5
Observation: Exit code: 0
