Syntax is now correct. Now I need to integrate the v40.23 functions into the main evaluation. Let me find where to add the integration:
Action: $ cd /app && grep -n "knightInfiltrationScore + checkSequenceDetectionScore + mustRespondScore" "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js"
Observation: 34212:                               knightInfiltrationScore + checkSequenceDetectionScore + mustRespondScore;
Exit code: 0
