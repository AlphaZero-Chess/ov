
Action: Based on my analysis:

1. The file is currently at version v40.20
2. The 31st session was working on implementing v40.21 with:
   - Deep Pawn Chain Calculation
   - Forcing Line Detection
   - Quiet Move Danger Detection
   
3. Looking at the session files, it seems v40.21 CONFIG parameters were added and some functions were implemented, but I need to verify:
   - Whether v40.21 functions are fully implemented
   - Whether they are integrated into the main evaluation
   - Whether the header was updated to v40.21

4. The most recent game in the problem statement shows:
```

Key issues in this game:
- Move 18 (Nxa7) - grabbing a pawn while the position is unraveling
- Move 20 (Bh3) - passive move when knight attack is coming
- Move 21 (a3) - completely ignoring the knight threat on g2
- Move 22 (Qxb6) - still grabbing material while getting mated

The bot is ignoring FORCING moves (knight checks) and allowing a simple mating attack. This shows that v40.21's forcing line detection STILL isn't working properly.

Let me check what functions exist and what's missing, then continue implementation.
