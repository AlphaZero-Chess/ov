Action: Let me analyze the user's most recent game from the problem statement:

```
[White "AlphaZero"]
[Black "lichess AI level 8"]
[Result "0-1"]
[ECO "B23"]
[Opening "Sicilian Defense: Closed"]

KEY ISSUES I SEE:

1. **MOVE 3: d3** - The bot STILL played d3 in the Sicilian Defense! After 1.e4 c5 2.Nc3, the bot should play d4 (Open Sicilian) or f4 (Grand Prix Attack), NOT d3 (Closed Sicilian)!

2. **MOVE 5: Qd2** - Queen development before completing minor piece development. This wastes tempo.

3. **MOVE 7: Qd1** - Queen RETREAT back to d1 after just moving to d2. This is a MASSIVE tempo loss and exactly the "queen shuffling" that should be penalized.

4. **MOVE 11: Re1** - Passive rook move, doesn't challenge black's position.

5. **MOVE 24: Re4 -> Bxd2** - The bot allowed the knight on d2 to be captured.

6. Overall position collapsed with material losses.

The user says this is the 51st session, and the file is at v40.33, but the bot is STILL playing passively with d3 moves. 

From reading the session files, I can see:
- v40.33 has "ABSOLUTE D3 PROHIBITION" functions
- These functions exist (v40AbsoluteD3ProhibitionEval and v40SicilianMasteryEval)
- The CONFIG has massive penalties for d3 (5 trillion bonus for d4 instead)

BUT the functions were NOT integrated into computeCombinedScore until session 51's fix attempt!

For the current session (continuing from session 51), I need to:
1. Verify the v40.33 integration is complete
2. Check if there are any other missing functions
3. Continue enhancements to make the bot truly superhuman

Let me view the current computeCombinedScore to see if the v40.33 integration was completed properly.
