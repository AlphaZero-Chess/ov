The hard filter is good. But I notice that the `v40MaxEarlyMoveNumber` is 12, and d3 rejection is only for moves <= 10. But the user complained that d3 was played on move 3. Let me check what `moveCount` is and how it's tracked:
Action: $ grep -n "let moveCount\|moveCount =\|moveCount++" "/app/Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | head -20
Observation: 36157:        const moveCount = pieceMovementHistory[pieceKey];
36161:            if (moveCount === 1) {
36163:            } else if (moveCount === 2) {
37466:let moveCount = 0;
42709:    moveCount = Math.floor((currentWsV + 1) / 2);
Exit code: 0
