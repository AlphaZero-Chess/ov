
Action: Based on my analysis:

1. CURRENT STATE (v40.9):
   - 27,937 lines of JavaScript code
   - Has extensive v40 evaluation functions
   - Has MCTS-related structures (MCTSNode, V38MCTSNode)
   - Session 19 added "Attacked Piece Priority System" to prevent ignoring attacked queens

2. LATEST GAME ANALYSIS:
The user shared a new game where the bot lost again:
[White "AlphaZero"] [Black "lichess AI level 8"]
1. e4 e5 2. d3 Nc6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 d5 5. exd5 Nxd5 6. Bd2 Be7 7. Be2 Be6 8. O-O O-O 
9. Nxd5 Qxd5 10. Be3 Rad8 11. c4 Qd6 12. Qe1 Bf5 13. Qc3 Rfe8 14. Rad1 Nd4 15. Bxd4 exd4 
16. Qb3 c5 17. Nd2 Bg5 18. Bf3 Bf4 19. a3 Bxh2+ 20. Kh1 Qh6 21. Bh5 Qxh5 22. Nf3 Bf4+ 
23. Kg1 Bg4 24. Rd2 Bxf3 25. Ra1 Qh2+ 26. Kf1 Bxg2# 0-1

PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED:
1. Move 2: d3 instead of d4 (passive opening - AGAIN!)
2. Move 18: Bf3 putting bishop where it can be captured 
3. Move 20: Kh1 - king going to corner when attacked
4. The bot allowed a devastating kingside attack

KEY ISSUES NOT FIXED:
1. OPENING AGGRESSION - Still playing d3 instead of d4
2. TACTICAL BLINDNESS - Missing Bxh2+ sacrifice possibilities
3. KING SAFETY - Not seeing the mating attack developing
4. The "v40 dominance" system isn't working effectively

The user wants a TRUE AlphaZero replica. What needs to be done:
1. Force d4 instead of d3 in opening
2. Better detection of sacrificial attacks on the king
3. Better mate pattern recognition
4. The entire evaluation system needs to actually PREVENT these disasters

From Session 19: The implementation added v40AttackedPiecePriorityEval but the bot is STILL making fundamental mistakes.

Let me look at the specific issues in the code and implement REAL fixes for v40.10.
