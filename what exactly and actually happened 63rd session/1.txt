
Action: Looking at the current state:
- The file is at v40.42 with 47,257 lines
- The user has tested and the bot still loses all games
- The most recent game analysis shows the bot still making critical mistakes

Based on the session 62 notes, I need to find and fix bugs related to pawn attack detection. I found that there are multiple places with the wrong pawn attack direction calculation. Let me:

1. Fix all the bugs found in session 62 (pawn attack direction was wrong)
2. Verify the fixes
3. Add additional improvements for the most recent game analysis

Key issues from the most recent game (B23 Sicilian Defense):
1. The bot lost with white as "AlphaZero" playing 1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Bb5 g6 5.d4 cxd4 6.e5 dxc3 7.exf6 cxb2 8.Bxb2 Qa5+ 
2. The bot allowed Black to capture b2 pawn and create a strong passed pawn
3. Allowed checkmate at move 30

I need to continue from where session 62 left off - fixing the pawn attack direction bugs and implementing new protections.
