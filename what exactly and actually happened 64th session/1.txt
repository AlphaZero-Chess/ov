
Action: Based on my analysis:

CURRENT STATE (v40.43):
- File has 47,290 lines
- Session 63 fixed pawn attack direction bugs in 5 places
- Bot is still losing to Lichess AI level 8

RECENT GAME ANALYSIS (from user's problem statement):
1. First game (B23 Sicilian Defense) - Bot lost as White:
   - 1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 g6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Ne2 e5 6. Ng3 h5 7. Bc4 h4 8. Ng5 Nh6 9. Ne2 f6 10. Nh3 g5...
   - Bot played badly: 5. Ne2 instead of Nxd4 (recapturing), then lost knight on c3
   - Key issue: NOT RECAPTURING the d4 pawn when it took the c3 knight's protection away

2. Second game (A40 Horwitz Defense) - Bot lost as BLACK:
   - 1. d4 e6 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. e3 d5... Bot as Black still played poorly
   - Key issue: Passive play, bad exchanges

3. Third game (B23 Sicilian) - Bot lost as White:
   - Similar pattern - allowing piece losses, passive play

KEY PROBLEMS TO FIX:
1. Bot STILL not recapturing pawns properly - even with all the "fix" functions
2. Bot plays passive moves instead of addressing threats
3. Knight safety is still failing
4. Opening principles are being violated

WHAT I NEED TO DO FOR SESSION 64:
1. Analyze WHY the existing v40.43 fixes aren't working
2. The pawn attack direction was wrong, but even with the fix, the bot loses
3. Need to add stronger OPENING BOOK / OPENING PRINCIPLES
4. Need to add ABSOLUTE RECAPTURE PRIORITY that overrides everything

The main issue seems to be that even though we have penalties, they aren't being applied correctly or the computeCombinedScore function isn't weighting them properly.

Let me:
1. Check the computeCombinedScore function to see how the scores are being combined
2. Add a v40.44 enhancement that implements ABSOLUTE OPENING PRINCIPLES
3. Add a v40.44 enhancement for ABSOLUTE RECAPTURE (no exceptions)
4. Make sure the knight/bishop protection is working

The key insight from the games is:
- Move 5: Ne2 instead of Nxd4 - the bot KNOWS d4 was taken but plays a random move
- This means the recapture penalty isn't strong enough or isn't being applied

I need to implement:
1. v40.44: ABSOLUTE RECAPTURE SYSTEM - When material is taken, MUST recapture or the move gets -Infinity score
2. v40.44: OPENING COHERENCE - Follow standard opening theory in the first 10 moves
3. v40.44: KNIGHT/BISHOP SAFETY VERIFICATION - Triple-check that pieces aren't being lost
