Now I understand the structure. The `computeCombinedScore` function combines all the various evaluation scores. The existing functions are being called but the bot is still losing. Let me analyze the recent games more carefully and implement a v40.44 enhancement.
Action: $ cd /app && grep -n "function v40MandatoryRecaptureEval" "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js"
Observation: 27726:function v40MandatoryRecaptureEval(fen, move, board, activeColor, moveNumber) {
Exit code: 0
