
Action: Based on my comprehensive review of all 7 sessions:

CURRENT STATE (v40.3 already partially implemented):
- File has 23,364 lines
- Version is 40.3.0-SUPERHUMAN-BEAST-ULTIMATE
- Syntax check passes
- Has 50K MCTS simulations configured
- Has 75% v40 dominance mentioned in description
- Has all v40.2 functions (prophylactic, rook infiltration, king safety corridors)

WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED ACROSS SESSIONS:
1st session: Initial v40 structure
2nd session: More v40 functions  
3rd session: Additional evaluation phases
4th session: More endgame enhancements
5th session: v40.1 - Increased weights, mating net detection, file control, initiative tracking, queen movement penalty
6th session: v40.2 - Prophylactic evaluation, rook infiltration detection, king safety corridors, increased to 65% dominance
7th session: v40.3 - Started implementing 50K simulations, 75% dominance (partially)

WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR v40.3 ULTIMATE:
1. Verify and ensure the 75% v40 dominance is actually in the code
2. Check if the Anti-Passivity System is implemented
3. Implement true 30+ move deep horizon evaluation
4. Enhanced mating pattern library (corner mate patterns like Ra1#)
5. Counterattack priority system
6. Space domination tracking

Let me check what's actually in the computeCombinedScore function to verify the weights, then implement missing functions.
