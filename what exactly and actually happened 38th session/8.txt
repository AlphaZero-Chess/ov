Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the codebase. Let me analyze the latest game and create a plan for v40.26:
Action: Based on my analysis of the code and the latest game loss, I can see the following issues:

GAME ANALYSIS - Caro-Kann Defense: Advance Variation, Van der Wiel Attack:
1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 Bf5 4. Nc3 e6 5. Nf3 Nd7 6. Be3 Bb4 7. Bd3 Ne7 8. Qd2 h6 9. O-O O-O 
10. Qd1 c5 11. Ne2 cxd4 12. Nexd4 Bxd3 13. Qxd3 Bc5 14. c3 Bb6 15. Qe2 Ng6 
16. Nb3 Bxe3 17. a3 Bf4 18. Nbd4 Rc8 19. Rae1 Ngxe5 20. Nxe5 Bxe5 
21. Nc2 Bd6 22. Qf3 Nc5 23. Nb4 Qg5 24. Qe3 Qh5 25. g3 (CATASTROPHIC WEAKNESS!)
26. Nd3 Ne4 27. f3 (ANOTHER WEAKNESS!) Bxg3 28. hxg3 Nxg3 29. Nf2 Nxf1 
30. Qe2 Qg3+ 31. Kxf1 Rfd8 ... (checkmate follows)

KEY FAILURES:
1. **Move 19 (Ngxe5)**: Allowed Black to capture e5 pawn - should have defended
2. **Move 25 (g3)**: CATASTROPHIC - weakened kingside while under attack!
3. **Move 27 (f3)**: FATAL - created another weakness
4. **Move 28 (hxg3)**: Allowed Bxg3 sacrifice
5. **PATTERN FAILURE**: Bot played g3/f3 creating target squares when queen was already threatening

The existing v40.25 has F3G3 prohibition but it's NOT working properly. The weights need to be MUCH higher and the detection needs to be improved.

For v40.26, I need to implement:

1. **v40.26: ABSOLUTE KINGSIDE PAWN PROHIBITION**
   - NEVER play g3, f3, h3 when enemy queen/pieces are active on kingside
   - Weight: 200+ (much higher than current 80)
   - Must detect when kingside is under pressure

2. **v40.26: BISHOP SACRIFICE DETECTION**
   - Detect Bxg3, Bxf3, Bxh3 sacrifice patterns
   - When opponent sacrifices bishop, there's ALWAYS a reason
   - Must calculate forcing sequence after sacrifice

3. **v40.26: KINGSIDE COLLAPSE PREVENTION**
   - If g-pawn or f-pawn moves forward, check all consequences
   - Detect when kingside shelter is being destroyed
   - ABSOLUTE rejection of kingside-weakening moves under attack

4. **v40.26: QUEEN ATTACKING PATTERN**
   - When enemy queen is on g5/h5/h4, bot is under attack
   - Must switch to defensive mode
   - Only defensive/counterattacking moves allowed

5. **v40.26: FORCED DEFENSE MODE**
   - When kingside is under attack, enter "FORTRESS MODE"
   - Only allow moves that defend the king
   - Penalize ALL non-defensive moves

6. **v40.26: DEEP SACRIFICE CALCULATION**
   - When opponent offers piece (especially bishop), calculate WHY
   - See 5+ moves of forcing line after sacrifice
   - Reject moves that allow devastating sacrifices

Let me implement v40.26 with these critical fixes.
