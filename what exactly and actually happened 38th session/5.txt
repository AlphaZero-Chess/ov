KEY FAILURES I CAN IDENTIFY:
1. **Move 19: Ngxe5** - The bot allowed Black to capture the e5 pawn with no compensation
2. **Move 22: Qf3** - Passive queen move instead of addressing threats
3. **Move 25: g3** - CATASTROPHIC - weakened the kingside, created the g3 weakness
4. **Move 26: Nd3** - Should have defended g3 differently
5. **Move 27: f3** - Another kingside weakness
6. **Move 28: hxg3** - Allowed devastating bishop sacrifice Bxg3
7. **Move 30: Qe2** - Didn't see the queen trap at g3

The main issues:
1. KINGSIDE WEAKENING - g3 was played when under attack
2. TACTICAL BLINDNESS - Didn't see the Bxg3 sacrifice
3. PAWN STRUCTURE COLLAPSE - Allowed kingside pawns to be destroyed
4. PIECE COORDINATION FAILURE - Pieces didn't coordinate for defense
5. NO COUNTERPLAY - Never generated any threats

Looking at all the games the user has shared, the bot is consistently:
1. Playing passively (d3 instead of d4, avoiding aggressive continuations)
2. Weakening kingside pawns (g3, h3, f3 under attack)
3. Missing tactical sequences (forks, sacrifices, mating patterns)
4. Losing material unnecessarily
5. Not recapturing pieces
6. Failing in time pressure situations

Despite having v40.25 with MANY safety systems, the bot still loses. This suggests the evaluation functions exist but:
1. They're not weighted heavily enough to override other considerations
2. They're not being called at the right time in the decision flow
3. The base move selection still prioritizes wrong things
4. The engine's evaluation is being trusted over the bot's safety systems

For the 38th session, I need to implement a v40.26 that:
1. Has ABSOLUTE KINGSIDE SAFETY - never allow g3/f3/h3 under attack
2. Better tactical sequence detection - see 3-5 move forcing lines
3. Better sacrifice detection - when pieces are offered, there's a reason
4. Forced defense mode - when under attack, ONLY defensive moves allowed
5. MATING NET DETECTION - see when opponent is building mating attack

Let me check the computeCombinedScore function to see how the evaluations are being combined.
