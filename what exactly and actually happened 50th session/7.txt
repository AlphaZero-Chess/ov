Now let me analyze the most recent game from the 49th session to understand what's still failing:
Action: Based on my analysis:

CURRENT STATE (v40.32):
- File has 43,507 lines
- Version: v40.32.0-BOOK-FILTER-COUNTERPLAY-MASTERY
- Has book hard filter that REJECTS d2d3, e2e3 from book moves
- Has counterplay generation systems
- Has tactical supremacy systems
- Has piece coordination evaluation

LATEST GAME ANALYSIS (from the user's problem statement - 49th session game):
[White "AlphaZero"]
[Black "lichess AI level 8"]
[Result "0-1"]
[ECO "B23"]
[Opening "Sicilian Defense: Closed"]
1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. d3 Nf6 4. Nf3 e5...

WAIT! The bot STILL played d3 on move 3! This means:
1. The book filter might not be active
2. Or the CONFIG settings aren't being applied
3. Or Nc3 is from book, then d3 is from engine (not book)

Looking at the opening:
1. e4 - Good, from book (forced e4)
2. Nc3 - This is from book (Closed Sicilian)
3. d3 - This is AFTER the book position - engine is choosing d3!

The issue is: After the book position ends, the HARD FILTER in applyAlphaZeroLogic should reject d2d3, but it seems the bot is still playing it.

Let me check if the hard filter is being applied correctly in the engine evaluation phase...

Actually wait - looking at the game: 1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. d3
After 2...d6, the position might not be in the opening book anymore, so the engine calculates d3.
The HARD FILTER should reject d3 in the first 10 moves, but it seems like it's not working.

Possible issues:
1. The hard filter might only check fromSquare=d2, toSquare=d3 but the FEN might have white to move from a different position
2. The move might be bypassing the filter somehow
3. The filter might have a bug

Let me look at the hard filter code and trace through what's happening.

Actually, looking more carefully at the code in applyAlphaZeroLogic:
- It checks if CONFIG.v40HardMoveFilterEnabled && moveCount <= 12
- It checks if fromSquare === 'd2' && toSquare === 'd3'

This should work! Unless moveCount is not being incremented properly, or the filter is being bypassed.

For v40.33, I should:
1. Add MORE aggressive rejection - reject d3 in ALL phases, not just opening
2. Add logging to confirm the filter is being called
3. Add redundant checks in multiple places
4. Ensure the engine never even considers d3 by adding it to the "forbidden moves" list

Also from the game analysis, I see these issues:
1. 2. Nc3 instead of 2. Nf3 or 2. d4 - The Closed Sicilian is fine but not AlphaZero's typical choice
2. 3. d3 - TERRIBLE passive move
3. The bot eventually collapsed tactically

For v40.33 SUPERHUMAN EVOLUTION, I'll implement:
1. ABSOLUTE d3 PROHIBITION - Never play d3 in ANY phase
2. ENHANCED Sicilian handling - Play d4/f4 against Sicilian
3. DEEPER tactical scanning
4. BETTER piece safety
5. STRONGER initiative maintenance
