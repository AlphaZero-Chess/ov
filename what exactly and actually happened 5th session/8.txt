Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the codebase. Let me analyze the game and identify the key issues, then implement the significant enhancements needed.
Action: GAME ANALYSIS - AlphaZero vs Lichess AI Level 8 (BLACK WON):

Key failures:
1. Move 4.Qxd4 - Recapturing but then immediately got the queen attacked
2. Move 5.Qd3 - Queen retreat, giving up initiative
3. Move 7...Ng4 - Allowed active knight attack on e5
4. Move 8.Qe4 f5 - Queen being pushed around
5. Move 9.Qd3 - Third queen move, lost all initiative
6. Move 13...f4 - Allowed aggressive pawn push without punishment
7. Move 18.Bf2 Bxc3 - Traded bishop for knight
8. Move 25.Rd4 Rxc4 - Allowed exchange of pieces in worse position
9. Move 26.Qb6 Rfc8 - Double rooks on c-file
10. Move 31.Ka2 R8c2+ - Allowed infiltration to second rank
11. Move 33.Qb2 Qc7 - Collapse
12. Final: 37...Rxa4# - Checkmate

CORE ISSUES:
1. Too many queen moves in the opening - lost initiative
2. Passive play when under pressure
3. Failed to generate counterplay
4. Failed to stop Black's c-file invasion
5. Failed to see the mating pattern
6. No coherent strategic plan

WHAT NEEDS TO BE ENHANCED:

1. **INITIATIVE TRACKING** - The bot needs to detect when it's losing initiative and take corrective action
2. **QUEEN EARLY MOVEMENT PENALTY** - Heavy penalty for too many queen moves in opening
3. **FILE CONTROL** - Better detection of dangerous open file control by opponent
4. **MATING NET DETECTION** - Earlier detection of mating patterns
5. **COUNTERPLAY GENERATION** - Force counterplay when position deteriorates
6. **STRATEGIC PLAN CONSISTENCY** - Stick to coherent plans

KEY ENHANCEMENTS TO IMPLEMENT:
1. v40 MCTS needs to be more deeply integrated - currently it's just 15% influence
2. Enhanced mating net detection in v40CheckMatingNet
3. Better c-file invasion detection
4. Initiative collapse detection
5. Improve the endgame evaluation to see mating nets earlier
6. Make v40 dominant in move selection (increase from 15% to 50%+)

Let me implement major enhancements to make this a TRUE AlphaZero replica.
