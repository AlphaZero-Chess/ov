
Action: Based on my comprehensive review of the codebase and session notes:

CURRENT STATE:
- The file has ~20,961 lines of code
- v40 is implemented with V40MCTSNode class and various v40 functions
- Syntax check passes (node -c reports no errors)
- There are 40 v40 functions implemented

KEY OBSERVATIONS FROM THE GAME ANALYSIS:
The provided game shows critical failures:
1. AlphaZero (white) lost to Lichess AI level 8 - which is unacceptable for a "superhuman" bot
2. Move 14...f4 (aggressive pawn push) wasn't punished
3. Allowing ...Bxc3 (giving up the knight pair)
4. Not stopping the c-file invasion (Rc8, Rxc3)
5. Complete collapse in the endgame
6. Allowing Rc1+ and checkmate with Ra1#

ISSUES TO FIX:
1. The current MCTS implementation may not be truly integrated into the move selection
2. The evaluation functions may not be properly penalizing passive play
3. Endgame evaluation may not be detecting zugzwang/mating nets early enough
4. The bot needs to detect pawn advances that weaken king safety
5. The bot needs better counterplay generation

Based on the feedback:
- "echoing nothing but mediocrity" - needs major improvements
- "knockoff toy than the real deal" - need to implement TRUE persistent MCTS with deep search
- Need moves that "look odd initially but pay off later"

The user wants me to:
1. Read the session notes (already understood)
2. Analyze the lost game deeply
3. Enhance the bot to true AlphaZero level

Let me check what needs to be enhanced in the actual v40 implementation. The key issues are likely:
1. v40 isn't properly integrated into move selection
2. The evaluation functions need stronger weights
3. The MCTS isn't doing proper deep search
4. Blunder detection isn't comprehensive enough

I need to view more of the implementation to see the actual integration and then make targeted improvements.
