Good, I can see the functions are implemented. Now let me analyze the specific game deeply. The user shared this game:

```
1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bd3 Bg4 6. c3 e6 7. Be3 Bd6 
8. O-O O-O 9. Nbd2 Nc6 10. Qc2 Rc8 11. Rad1 Nb4 12. Qb1 Nxd3 13. Qxd3 Qb6 
...
```

Let me analyze what went wrong. Let me check if there's any issue with how the board state is generated from FEN:
Action: $ cd /app && grep -n "function fenToBoard\|function createBoardFromFen\|function parseFen" "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | head -20
Observation: 26483:function parseFenToBoard(fen) {
Exit code: 0
