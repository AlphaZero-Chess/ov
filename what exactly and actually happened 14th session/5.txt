Now let me add the new v40.5 evaluation functions. First, let me find the right location (after the v40.4 functions):
Action: $ grep -n "function v40PawnShieldIntegrityEval" "/app/Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js"
Observation: 6866:function v40PawnShieldIntegrityEval(fen, move, board, activeColor) {
Exit code: 0
