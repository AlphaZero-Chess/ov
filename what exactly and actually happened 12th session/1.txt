
Action: Based on my comprehensive review of all session files (1st through 11th), I now have a complete picture:

SESSIONS SUMMARY:
- Sessions 1-8: Built initial v40 system with MCTS, various evaluation functions
- Session 9: Implemented v40.3 with:
  - Enhanced Space Domination with territory depth calculation
  - Open file control detection
  - Outpost control
  - Pawn chain space evaluation
  
- Session 10: Analyzed the NEW game loss and started v40.4 planning:
  - Identified issues: d3 passive opening, Nxg3+ missed, Qxg2# not anticipated
  - Updated header to v40.4 GODLIKE
  - Added v40.4 CONFIG parameters
  
- Session 11: Started implementing v40.4 functions:
  - Added v40OpeningPrinciplesEvaluation
  - Added v40EnhancedDiscoveredAttackDetection
  - Added v40KnightInvasionPenalty  
  - Added v40EnhancedQueenMatingPatterns
  - Added v40PawnShieldIntegrityEval
  - Integrated into computeCombinedScore with 80% dominance
  - The 11th session ended at "Now update the weighted merge comment"

So the 11th session was nearly complete - it was just updating the weighted merge comment. Let me check what's in the current file and continue from where we left off.

WHAT I NEED TO DO NOW (continuing 11th session -> 12th session):
1. Update the weighted merge comment to reflect 80% v40 dominance
2. Verify all v40.4 functions are properly implemented and integrated
3. Check for syntax errors
4. Look for any additional improvements needed

The key issues from the test games were:
1. Passive opening (d3) - ADDRESSED by v40OpeningPrinciplesEvaluation
2. Knight tactics missed (Nxg3+) - ADDRESSED by v40EnhancedDiscoveredAttackDetection and v40KnightInvasionPenalty  
3. Queen mate on g2 - ADDRESSED by v40EnhancedQueenMatingPatterns and v40PawnShieldIntegrityEval

Let me now view the current state of the file and continue implementing.
