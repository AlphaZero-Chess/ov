Now let me update the weighted merge to reflect 80% v40 dominance (as per the v40.4 integration):
Action: file_editor str_replace /app/Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js --old-str "        // v40.3: TRUE ALPHAZERO weighted merge — v40 ULTIMATE DOMINANT (75%)
        // Engine provides baseline, but v40 superhuman evaluation is ABSOLUTE PRIMARY
        const combinedScore = (
            TRUE_ALPHAZERO.qWeight * engine_Q * 0.25 +  // Engine reduced to 25%
            TRUE_ALPHAZERO.rolloutWeight * rollout_Q * 0.25 +
            normalizedPolicyPrior * 0.5 + // Policy bonus reduced
            v40Bonus                      // v40 ULTIMATE DOMINANT at 75%
        );" --new-str "        // v40.4: TRUE ALPHAZERO GODLIKE weighted merge — v40 GODLIKE DOMINANT (80%)
        // Engine provides minimal baseline, but v40 superhuman evaluation is ABSOLUTE DOMINANT
        const combinedScore = (
            TRUE_ALPHAZERO.qWeight * engine_Q * 0.20 +  // Engine reduced to 20%
            TRUE_ALPHAZERO.rolloutWeight * rollout_Q * 0.20 +
            normalizedPolicyPrior * 0.4 + // Policy bonus reduced further
            v40Bonus                      // v40 GODLIKE DOMINANT at 80%
        );"
