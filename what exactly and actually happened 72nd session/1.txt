
Action Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the project and what was done in previous sessions

1. This is a Lichess bot userscript (TampermonkeyGreasemonkey) that aims to be an AlphaZero replica
2. The bot has been through 70+ sessions of improvements (v40.x versions)
3. The main problems still persist
   - Bot still loses to Lichess AI level 8
   - Not recapturing properly (e.g., Ne2 instead of Nxd4)
   - Getting checkmated frequently
   - Opening passivity

Key issues identified from session 71
- Book moves bypass the hard filter - PARTIALLY FIXED with mustRecaptureMove check
- The applyAlphaZeroLogic function has early returns that bypass filtering
- Mate threats are not being detected early enough

The syntax was verified as correct in session 71, but the bot is still losing. The user wants me to continue from session 71 and implement more improvements.

Looking at the latest games provided
1. Sicilian games Bot plays bad moves like Ne2 instead of Nxd4
2. Bot gets checkmated in various positions
3. Bot doesn't generate counterplay

I need to
1. First check the current state of the file
2. Review what v40.50 has already implemented
3. Add more critical fixes
   - Ensure all move paths check for forced recaptures
   - Add better mate threat detection
   - Improve tactical awareness

Let me check the current version header and state of the file.
