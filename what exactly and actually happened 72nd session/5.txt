Good - syntax is valid. Now let me analyze the most recent games from the problem statement to understand the current issues:
Action: Looking at the most recent games from the problem statement (session 63 onwards):

Game 1 (Sicilian):
1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 g6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Ne2 ...
- After cxd4, bot should play Nxd4 (recapture) but played Ne2 (terrible!)
- This was the bug that session 71 was trying to fix with mustRecaptureMove check

Game 2 (Horwitz Defense - Bot plays Black):
1. d4 e6 2. Bf4 Nf6... Bot lost as Black
- The bot lost with Black pieces

Game 3 (Sicilian again):
1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 e6... Bot played 4. Bb5?!
- Still losing in Sicilian lines

The core issues:
1. RECAPTURE BUG: When a central pawn is captured, bot doesn't always recapture
2. TACTICAL BLINDNESS: Bot misses forcing sequences leading to mate
3. PASSIVE PLAY: Bot makes passive moves instead of aggressive ones
4. GETTING CHECKMATED: Bot doesn't see mate threats coming

I need to implement v40.51 with these critical fixes:
1. ABSOLUTE RECAPTURE SYSTEM - must work 100% of the time
2. MATE THREAT DETECTION - must detect mate in 3-5 moves
3. FORCING LINE CALCULATOR - must see deep tactical sequences
4. PIECE SAFETY CHECK - must verify every piece is safe before moving

Let me view the current computeCombinedScore function to see what's already implemented and what needs improvement.
Observation: Your thought has been logged.
