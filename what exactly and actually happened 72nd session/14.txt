Good, it's set to `true`. The issue might be in the moveCount not being calculated correctly. Let me check where `moveCount` is set when processing a position:
Action: $ cd /app && grep -n "moveCount\s*=" "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | head -20
Observation: 40019:        const moveCount = pieceMovementHistory[pieceKey];
40023:            if (moveCount === 1) {
40025:            } else if (moveCount === 2) {
41328:let moveCount = 0;
47028:    moveCount = Math.floor((currentWsV + 1) / 2);
Exit code: 0
