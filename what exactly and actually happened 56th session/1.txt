Syntax is valid. Now let me analyze the most recent game from the problem statement (session 55):
Action: The most recent game from the problem statement is:

[White "AlphaZero"]
[Black "lichess AI level 8"]
[Result "0-1"]
[Opening "Sicilian Defense: Closed"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Qxd4 e5 6. Nxe5 dxe5 7. Qe3 Nc6 8. Bc4 Nd4 9. Qd3 Bc5 10. Be3 O-O 11. O-O-O Bd7 12. Kb1 Rb8 13. Nd5 Ng4 14. Bxd4 Bxd4 15. Qf1 b5 16. Be2 b4 17. Rd3 Nf6 18. c3 bxc3 19. Nxf6+ Qxf6 20. Rxd4 Rxb2+ 21. Ka1 exd4 22. Qe1 Be6 23. Bh5 Rfb8 24. Qe2 c2 25. Bxf7+ Bxf7 26. Qxc2 Rxc2 27. f3 Rxa2#

KEY ISSUES:
1. Move 5: Qxd4 - Queen captured pawn early - v40.36 should prohibit this
2. Move 6: Nxe5 - Knight sacrifice - v40.36 should prohibit this 
3. Move 11: O-O-O - Castled into danger - v40.36 should detect this
4. Move 14: Bxd4 - Bad exchange
5. Move 17: Rd3 - Passive rook move
6. Move 20: Rxd4 - Desperate rook take

Since v40.36 is already implemented with:
- Queen Capture Prohibition
- Knight Sacrifice Prevention
- Castling Direction Analysis
- Exchange Quality Verification
- Piece Activity Requirement

I need to check if the functions are properly integrated and working. Let me also check if there are any bugs or if the penalties are not strong enough.

Also, looking at the debug logs, the functions seem to be integrated into computeCombinedScore. Let me verify this and then implement any additional fixes needed.

The user is now at session 55, and the plan was to continue implementing improvements. Based on the session logs, v40.36 was being added and integrated. Now I should:
1. Verify all v40.36 functions are properly implemented
2. Check if they're integrated into computeCombinedScore
3. Verify the syntax
4. Add any missing helper functions
5. Update the header version if needed
6. Test and report on what was done
