
Action: This is a large JavaScript userscript file (~17,700 lines based on the context). I can see the structure:

1. Lines 1-785: CONFIG settings with extensive parameters
2. Lines 787-1059: MCTSNode and V38MCTSNode classes
3. The file continues with more code that was clipped

Based on the problem statement and previous analysis, the current implementation has "fake" MCTS - it doesn't maintain a proper persistent tree, doesn't have real backpropagation through tree searches, and the selection/simulation phases aren't properly implemented.

I need to implement TRUE AlphaZero-style MCTS with:
1. TRUE Persistent MCTS with proper tree structure
2. PUCT selection exactly like AlphaZero paper
3. Real rollouts/simulations with deep evaluation
4. Proper backpropagation of values
5. Enhanced evaluation functions for value network emulation
6. Policy network emulation for move priors
7. Extended strategic horizon (30+ moves)
8. Better endgame techniques (opposition, triangulation, zugzwang, Philidor, Lucena)
9. Multi-pass tactical verification for zero blunders
10. Resilience features (counterplay, fortress, swindles)

Let me search for key functions to understand the structure better.
