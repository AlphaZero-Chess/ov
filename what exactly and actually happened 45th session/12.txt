Now let me analyze the latest game to understand the remaining issues and implement v40.30. Looking at the latest game:

```
[White "AlphaZero"]
[Black "lichess AI level 8"]
Sicilian Defense: Closed
1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. d3 ...
```

The bot played d3 (passive) instead of d4 (aggressive). Let me check the v40.8 OpeningAggressionEval function to see why it's not working:
Action: $ cd /app && grep -n "v40OpeningAggressionEval\|d3 is passive\|d4 is aggressive" "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | head -20
Observation: 9944:function v40OpeningAggressionEval(fen, move, board, activeColor, moveNumber) {
39140:                const openingAggressionScore = v40OpeningAggressionEval(fen, move, board, activeColor, moveNumber) * 1.5;
Exit code: 0
