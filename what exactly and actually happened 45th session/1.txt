Now let me analyze the recent game to understand the remaining issues:
Action: Based on my analysis of the session files and the current state:

**Current Version:** v40.28 ABSOLUTE SACRIFICE VERIFICATION
**File size:** ~42,296 lines

**Latest Game Analysis (Sicilian Defense: Closed):**
```

```

**Critical Problems in this game:**
1. Move 3. d3 - Passive, bot should play d4 or Bc4 for better center control
2. Move 5. Qd2 - Too early queen move, doesn't develop
3. Move 7. Qd1 - Queen retreated, wasting tempo  
4. Move 16. c3 allowed Nxf3+ knight fork winning material
5. Bot allowed tactical shot - knight fork wasn't prevented
6. Piece coordination collapsed after material loss
7. Bot didn't see the knight fork threat coming

**What session 44 was supposed to implement (but no actual code was written):**
The 44th session only contains analysis thoughts but no actual implementation. The session files show the user analyzing the game and identifying issues, but no v40.29 was actually implemented.

**What needs to be done now (v40.29):**
1. ANTI-FORK DETECTION - Detect and prevent knight forks
2. PIECE COORDINATION - Keep pieces working together
3. OPENING QUALITY - Avoid passive openings like d3
4. TEMPO AWARENESS - Don't waste moves
5. THREAT ANTICIPATION - See threats 2-3 moves ahead
6. DEFENSIVE URGENCY - Know when to defend

Let me now implement v40.29 with these improvements. I need to:
1. Find where v40.28 functions end (around line 22406)
2. Add new v40.29 CONFIG parameters
3. Add new v40.29 functions
4. Integrate into computeCombinedScore
