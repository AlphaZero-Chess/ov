**FOUND IT!** The `simulateMoveOnBoard` function is NOT defined in the codebase! This is a CRITICAL BUG. The function is called 27 times but never defined. This explains why the bot is not working correctly!

Let me verify this and check what happens when the bot runs:
Action: $ cd /app && grep -c "^function simulateMoveOnBoard\|function simulateMoveOnBoard\(" "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js"
Observation: [stderr] grep: Unmatched ( or \(
Exit code: 2
