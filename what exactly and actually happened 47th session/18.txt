I see - `simBoard` is used inline but `simulateMoveOnBoard` is called as a function. Let me find where it's defined:
Action: $ cd /app && grep -n "function simulateMoveOnBoard\|const simulateMoveOnBoard\|let simulateMoveOnBoard\|simulateMoveOnBoard =" "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | head -10
Observation: Exit code: 0
