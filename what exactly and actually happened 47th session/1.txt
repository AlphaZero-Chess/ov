
Action: Based on my analysis:

**SESSION 46 STATUS**: The session implemented v40.30 with:
1. Absolute Opening Prohibition (d3/e3 forbidden in first 10 moves)
2. Deep Fork Vision (see forks 1-3 moves ahead)
3. Bishop Pair Preservation
4. Piece Activity Supreme
5. Center Control Absolute
6. Tactical Blindness Elimination

The user provided a NEW GAME that I need to analyze:
```
1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. d3 Nf6 4. Nf3 e5 5. Qd2 Be6 6. Be2 Nc6 7. Qd1 h6 8. Be3 Nd4 9. O-O Be7 10. Nd2 O-O 11. Re1 Qb6 12. Rb1 Qc6 13. b3 b5 14. Bf3 b4 15. Na4 Rac8 16. c3 Nxf3+ 17. Qxf3 Ng4 18. Qg3 f5... (Black wins)
```

KEY ISSUES IN THIS GAME:
1. Move 3. d3 - Bot STILL played d3 even with v40.30 opening prohibition!
2. Move 5. Qd2 - Early queen move, wasting tempo
3. Move 7. Qd1 - Queen retreats, losing 2 tempos!
4. Move 16. c3 - Allows Nxf3+ knight fork
5. Bot didn't see the Nxf3+ threat

This means v40.30 is NOT WORKING properly or the penalties are not high enough. The bot still:
- Plays passive d3 instead of d4
- Makes pointless queen moves (Qd2-Qd1)
- Misses knight forks

I need to continue implementing improvements. For session 47, I should:
1. Verify the v40.30 functions exist and are syntactically correct
2. Check if CONFIG parameters are properly set
3. INCREASE THE PENALTIES - they might be too low
4. Add v40.31 with:
   - ABSOLUTE QUEEN DEVELOPMENT PROHIBITION - no Qd2/Qe2 before move 10
   - TEMPO TRACKING - penalize moves that lose tempo
   - KNIGHT FORK ABSOLUTE DEFENSE - check ALL possible knight forks
   - PIECE COORDINATION - pieces must defend each other

Let me check the current CONFIG values and verify the v40.30 functions exist.
