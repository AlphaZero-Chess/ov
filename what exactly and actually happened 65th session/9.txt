Now let me implement the v40.45 functions. First, let me find the right location to add them:
Action: $ cd /app && grep -n "function v40BishopB5HangingEval" "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js"
Observation: 28976:function v40BishopB5HangingEval(fen, move, board, activeColor, moveNumber) {
Exit code: 0
