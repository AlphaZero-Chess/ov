
Action: Current state analysis:
1. The file is at v40.44 with 47,736 lines
2. Session 64 added the v40.44 functions implementation
3. The user has tested and still sees losses in recent games

Looking at the problem statement, there are THREE NEW GAMES to analyze:

GAME 1 (B23 Sicilian):
1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 g6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Ne2 e5 6. Ng3 h5 7. Bc4 h4 8. Ng5 Nh6 9. Ne2 f6 10. Nh3 g5...
Key issue: Move 5. Ne2 instead of Nxd4 (NOT recapturing the d4 pawn!)

GAME 2 (A40 Horwitz) - Bot playing BLACK and LOST:
1. d4 e6 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. e3 d5... 
Key issue: Passive play as Black

GAME 3 (B23 Sicilian):
1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 e6 4. Bb5 Nd4 5. Bd3 Nf6 6. e5 Ng8...
Key issue: Move 6. e5 was bad, knight retreats

The user wants me to continue the 64th session plans which were about implementing v40.44 functions and integrating them. Looking at the session files, the functions were added but need to be INTEGRATED into computeCombinedScore.

Let me:
1. First verify the v40.44 functions exist
2. Find where they need to be integrated into computeCombinedScore
3. Add the integration calls
4. Update the header to v40.45

The key problems from analyzing the games:
1. Bot NOT recapturing central pawns (d4 pawn capture)
2. Bot pushing pawns (e5) when pieces are under attack
3. Bot playing passive moves
4. Bot not protecting knights under pawn attack

The v40.44 functions I added should handle these cases, but they need to be called in computeCombinedScore.
