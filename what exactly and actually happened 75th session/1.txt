
Action: Based on my analysis:

1. The file is at v40.51 with ~49,136 lines
2. Looking at the recent game losses, the bot is still getting crushed with patterns like:
   - Getting checkmated within 30 moves
   - Passive play (d3 instead of d4)
   - Missing tactical threats
   - Getting outplayed positionally

The user wants me to continue from session 73 (now at session 74) and continue the v40.52 update that was planned in session 73. Let me update the header to v40.52 and add new enhancements based on the recent game analysis.

Key issues from the games shown:
1. Bot plays passive opening moves
2. Bot misses threats to its pieces
3. Bot gets checkmated easily - missed defensive resources
4. Bot doesn't properly recapture on central squares

I need to:
1. Update the header to v40.52
2. Add enhanced functions for deeper tactical awareness
3. Add better endgame/checkmate detection
4. Add stronger opening enforcement (d4 not d3)
