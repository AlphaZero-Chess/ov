Key issues in this game:
1. Move 3. d3 - BOT STILL PLAYS d3! This is the critical passive opening move that should be forbidden
2. Move 5. Qd2 - Early queen move, wastes time
3. Move 7. Qd1 - Queen retreats, losing tempo
4. Move 16. c3 - Allowed Nxf3+ knight fork! Bot didn't see the fork threat
5. After the fork, material was lost and position collapsed

The v40.29 integration was fixed in session 45, but the main problem remains:
1. The bot STILL plays d3 (passive opening)
2. The bot STILL allows knight forks
3. The v40.30 CONFIG is added but the FUNCTIONS are NOT implemented

So I need to:
1. Implement v40.30 functions (ABSOLUTE OPENING PROHIBITION, DEEP FORK VISION, etc.)
2. Integrate them into computeCombinedScore
3. Update header to v40.30

This is what the user wants me to continue in this session 46.
