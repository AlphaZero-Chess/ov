
Action: Based on my analysis of the session files:

**Sessions 1-44:** Implemented v40.1 through v40.28 with many evaluation functions
**Session 45:** Discovered critical bug - v40.29 scores were calculated but NOT integrated into v40DeepScore. Fixed this.

**Current State (from session 45):**
- v40.29 was partially implemented - CONFIG params and functions exist
- The scores were being calculated but NOT added to the final v40DeepScore sum
- Session 45 fixed that bug by adding the v40.29 scores to the integration

Key issues in this game:
1. Move 3. d3 - Passive, should play d4 for center control
2. Move 5. Qd2 - Too early queen move
3. Move 7. Qd1 - Wasting tempo with queen retreat
4. Move 16. c3 allowed Nxf3+ knight fork
5. Bot didn't see the knight fork threat

The user is at session 46 now (since they mentioned 45th is done) and wants me to continue improving the bot.

I need to:
1. Continue reading the session 45 files to understand what was done
2. Check what needs to be implemented next
3. Analyze the recent game they provided to identify issues
4. Implement v40.30 or continue fixing issues

Let me continue reading the 45th session files to understand the full state.
