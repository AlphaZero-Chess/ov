
Action: Based on my analysis of the codebase and the session history:

CURRENT STATE (v40.47):
1. The file has ~48,153 lines with valid syntax
2. Version is v40.47 FORCE RECAPTURE SUPREME
3. The hard filter has been implemented with:
   - Central pawn recapture rule (v40.46)
   - Knight under pawn attack rule (v40.46)
   - Pawn push with hanging pieces rule (v40.46)
   - Force recapture fallback when all moves filtered (v40.47)

THE PROBLEM (from test games):
The bot is STILL losing to Lichess AI Level 8. Looking at the recent games:
- Still making passive moves
- Still losing pieces to simple tactics
- Still getting mated in elementary positions

KEY ISSUES TO ADDRESS for v40.48:
1. The hard filter may be TOO restrictive or NOT restrictive enough
2. The MCTS isn't finding the best moves
3. The tactical verification isn't catching blunders
4. The evaluation functions may have bugs

ANALYSIS OF RECENT GAME:
[White "AlphaZero"] vs [Black "lichess AI level 8"]
1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 g6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Ne2...

Move 5. Ne2 is TERRIBLE! Should be 5. Nxd4 (recapture the central pawn).
- After 4...cxd4, black pawn is on d4
- The filter should require recapturing with Nf3xd4
- But the bot played Ne2 instead

Let me check if the `canPieceCapture` function is working correctly...

PLAN FOR 68TH SESSION (continuing 67th):
1. First check and fix the `canPieceCapture` function if buggy
2. Add MORE aggressive central pawn recapture logic  
3. Add piece safety checks to avoid losing pieces
4. Implement stronger tactical threat detection
5. Add a "MUST NOT RETREAT KNIGHT WHEN CAPTURE IS POSSIBLE" rule
6. Update version to v40.48

Let me view the canPieceCapture function to make sure it's working correctly...
