
Action: Based on my analysis of the session files (1-22) and the current code, here's what I understand:

CURRENT STATE (v40.12):
- The bot is at version 40.11/40.12 with over 30,000 lines
- Has extensive evaluation functions for kingside attack detection, prophylactic exchange, etc.
- Bot is STILL LOSING to Lichess AI level 8

LATEST GAME ANALYSIS (French Defense - user's last shared game):
```
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Bd3 exd3 5. Ne4 Qxd4 6. Be3 Qxe4 7. cxd3 Qxg2 
8. Qd2 Qxh1 9. O-O-O Qxh2 10. Bf4 Qh4 11. Bxc7 Qb4 12. d4 Qxd2+ 13. Kxd2 Nc6 
14. Kc3 Nge7 15. Kc2 g5 16. Bd6 Bg7 17. Kd3 Nxd4 18. Be5 Bxe5 19. a3 f6 
20. f3 b6 21. Kc3 Nxf3+ 22. Kd3 Nxg1 23. b3 Ba6+ 24. Ke3 Nd5+ 25. Rxd5 exd5 
26. Kf2 Ne2 27. Kf3 Nd4+ 28. Ke3 Rc8 29. Kf2 Rc2+ 30. Ke3 Re2# 
```

The bot is making TERRIBLE mistakes:
1. Move 4: Bd3 allows exd3, losing material
2. Move 5: Ne4 allows Qxd4 forking
3. Move 6-7: Continues to lose material (Qxe4, Qxg2)
4. Move 8-9: Loses rook (Qxh1)
5. Basically completely collapsed

THE CORE PROBLEM: The bot's evaluation functions exist but:
1. The weights might not be strong enough
2. The functions might not be detecting early-move threats
3. The opening play is atrocious

According to session 22, the plan was to update the header to v40.12. But looking at the games, the bot needs MUCH more fundamental fixes:

1. OPENING PRINCIPLES - The bot is playing terrible opening moves
2. MATERIAL AWARENESS - Not detecting when queen is about to eat everything
3. BLUNDER DETECTION - Not seeing simple piece losses
4. TACTICAL AWARENESS - Missing basic tactics

I need to:
1. Read more recent session files to see what was planned
2. Identify why the evaluation functions aren't working
3. Potentially increase weights or fix bugs in the implementation
4. Add v40.13 with improved opening play and tactical awareness

The sessions said to continue with plans from session 22 about updating the header to v40.12 and then testing.
