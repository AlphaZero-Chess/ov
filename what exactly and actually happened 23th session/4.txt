**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**

Move 3: 3. Nc3 dxe4 - Black takes pawn, but fine so far

Move 4: **4. Bd3??** - This is TERRIBLE! 
- Black captures exd3 (winning a pawn for nothing)
- The bishop is placed where the pawn will take it
- Better would be 4. Nxe4

Move 5: **5. Ne4 Qxd4** - Now the queen attacks and takes the d4 pawn
- Position is already lost

Move 6-7: **6. Be3 Qxe4 7. cxd3 Qxg2** 
- Bot loses another piece, then queen infiltrates and takes g2
- TOTAL DISASTER

Move 8-9: **8. Qd2 Qxh1 9. O-O-O** 
- Bot loses the h1 rook!
- Now down massive material

The bot played several BLUNDERS:
1. Bd3 allowing exd3
2. Not defending d4 pawn 
3. Losing pieces one after another
4. Queen infiltration eating everything

The issue is NOT the v40 evaluation functions - those are detecting kingside attacks AFTER THEY HAPPEN.

The REAL PROBLEM is:
1. **BASIC MATERIAL LOSS** - Bot is playing moves that immediately lose material
2. **OPENING BLUNDERS** - Bd3 is a terrible move that loses a pawn
3. **TACTICAL BLINDNESS** - Not seeing simple captures

The v40 functions are focused on:
- Kingside attack detection
- Prophylactic exchange evaluation
- Pawn storm detection

BUT the bot is losing because of SIMPLE TACTICAL BLUNDERS in the opening!

I need to add:
1. **IMMEDIATE CAPTURE DETECTION** - Before playing any move, check if it hangs a piece
2. **RECAPTURE CALCULATION** - Before placing piece somewhere, check if it will be captured
3. **QUEEN INFILTRATION PREVENTION** - Don't allow queen to reach squares where it eats everything
4. **BASIC MATERIAL AWARENESS** - Simple count of material before/after move

Let me create v40.13 with these critical fixes for BASIC TACTICAL AWARENESS.
