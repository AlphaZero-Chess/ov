
Action: Based on my review of the session logs:

SESSION 53rd: 
- Implemented v40.35 functions for passive pawn prohibition, material safety, tactical verification, central control priority, and piece coordination
- Fixed a syntax error where findAttackedPiecesV40_9 function definition was missing

SESSION 54th:
- Integrated v40.35 functions into computeCombinedScore
- Updated blacklist thresholds for timeWasting moves from 15 to 30
- Successfully completed syntax validation

Now I need to:
1. Check the current state of the file
2. Analyze the most recent game from session 54 (Sicilian Defense: Closed game)
3. Continue implementing improvements

The game shows:
1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Qxd4 e5 6. Nxe5 dxe5 7. Qe3 Nc6 8. Bc4 Nd4 9. Qd3 Bc5 10. Be3 O-O 11. O-O-O Bd7 12. Kb1 Rb8 13. Nd5 Ng4 14. Bxd4 Bxd4 15. Qf1 b5 16. Be2 b4 17. Rd3 Nf6 18. c3 bxc3 19. Nxf6+ Qxf6 20. Rxd4 Rxb2+ 21. Ka1 exd4 22. Qe1 Be6 23. Bh5 Rfb8 24. Qe2 c2 25. Bxf7+ Bxf7 26. Qxc2 Rxc2 27. f3 Rxa2#

Critical errors:
- Move 5: Qxd4 - Queen capture too early (should be Nxd4)
- Move 6: Nxe5 dxe5 - Lost a knight for a pawn
- Move 11: O-O-O - Castled into danger
- Move 13: Nd5 - Jumped knight into danger, got pinned
- Move 14: Bxd4 - Bad exchange, gave up bishop for knight
- Move 17: Rd3 - Passive move
- Move 22: Qe1 - Passive queen move
- The bot lost due to tactical oversights and passive play

I need to:
1. View the current state of the file to understand what's implemented
2. Continue with v40.36 enhancements focusing on:
   - Better Qxd4 prohibition (never capture with Queen early)
   - Castle direction analysis (don't castle into attack)
   - Exchange evaluation (don't exchange when losing)
   - Tactical threat detection

Let me examine the file to see its current state and continue from there.
