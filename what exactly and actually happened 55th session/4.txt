Now let me analyze the most recent game and implement v40.36 fixes:
Action: Analyzing the most recent game from the problem statement:

[White "AlphaZero"]
[Black "lichess AI level 8"]
[Result "0-1"]
[Opening "Sicilian Defense: Closed"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Qxd4 e5 6. Nxe5 dxe5 7. Qe3 Nc6 8. Bc4 Nd4 9. Qd3 Bc5 10. Be3 O-O 11. O-O-O Bd7 12. Kb1 Rb8 13. Nd5 Ng4 14. Bxd4 Bxd4 15. Qf1 b5 16. Be2 b4 17. Rd3 Nf6 18. c3 bxc3 19. Nxf6+ Qxf6 20. Rxd4 Rxb2+ 21. Ka1 exd4 22. Qe1 Be6 23. Bh5 Rfb8 24. Qe2 c2 25. Bxf7+ Bxf7 26. Qxc2 Rxc2 27. f3 Rxa2#

CRITICAL MISTAKES:

Move 5: Qxd4 - TERRIBLE! Queen captures pawn too early, becomes target
Move 6: Nxe5 - Sacrifices knight for nothing, opponent plays dxe5
Move 11: O-O-O - Castles queenside into danger when pieces are attacking from b8
Move 13: Nd5 - Knight jumps into position where it can be undermined
Move 14: Bxd4 - Exchanges bishop for knight when position is already compromised
Move 17: Rd3 - Passive rook move, doesn't address threats
Move 20: Rxd4 - Takes with rook when position is lost

THE ROOT CAUSE ISSUES:
1. Qxd4 early queen capture - Already in blacklist but penalty not strong enough
2. Nxe5 knight sacrifice without compensation - Need to verify piece safety BEFORE moves
3. O-O-O when queenside is under pressure - Need castling direction evaluation
4. Exchange evaluations are wrong - Don't trade when in bad position

I need to implement v40.36 with:
1. ABSOLUTE Qxd4 prohibition - much stronger penalty
2. KNIGHT SACRIFICE PREVENTION - Don't sacrifice knight for pawn
3. CASTLING DIRECTION ANALYSIS - Don't castle into danger
4. EXCHANGE QUALITY VERIFICATION - Don't trade when position is compromised
5. PIECE ACTIVITY BEFORE DEFENSE - Develop pieces before passive moves

Let me find where to add these new functions and integrate them.
