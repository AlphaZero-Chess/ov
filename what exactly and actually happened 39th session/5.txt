Now I can see that v40.26 functions exist but I need to check if they're integrated. Let me check the v40.26 related scores in the combined calculation:
Action: $ grep -n "v40AbsoluteKingsidePawnProhibition\|v40BishopSacrificeDetection\|v40ForcedDefenseMode\|v40QueenKingsideThreat\|v40DeepSacrificeCalc\|v40KingsideCollapseDetection" "/app/Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | grep -E "Score|= v40" | head -20
Observation: Exit code: 0
