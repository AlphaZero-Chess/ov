Good, the features are enabled. Now let me deeply analyze the latest game loss:
Action: **DEEP ANALYSIS OF LATEST GAME (French Defense loss):**

```
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5  ← Good opening
4. Bd3 Bd6 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. Be3 c6 7. Nf3 Na6 
8. Ne5 Nc5 9. O-O Nxd3 10. Qxd3 O-O 
11. Bg5 Qc7 12. Bxf6 gxf6  ← CRITICAL: Bot took Bxf6, allowing gxf6 opening g-file
13. Nf3 Qd7 14. Qd2 Kh8 15. Ne2 Rg8 ← Rook goes to g-file
16. Ng3 Qg4 ← Queen infiltrating to g4
17. a3 f5 18. b3 f4  ← Bot plays passive a3, b3 while f5-f4 pawn storm coming
19. c3 fxg3 20. fxg3 Bf5 ← Knight removed, bishop now targeting h3
21. Ne5 Bxe5 22. dxe5 Be6
23. h3 Qxg3 ← h3 creates weakness, Qxg3 crushing
24-32: Complete collapse, checkmate
```

**KEY MISTAKES:**
1. **Move 12: Bxf6** - The bot initiated this exchange! This was TERRIBLE because gxf6 opens the g-file directly toward the white king who had castled kingside.

2. **Moves 17-19: a3, b3, c3** - Bot plays PASSIVE queenside pawn moves while being attacked on the kingside. This is exactly what v40.11 should prevent.

3. **Move 23: h3** - Playing h3 when the queen is on g4 creates a fatal weakness. Qxg3 wins the g3 pawn and the attack is devastating.

**WHY V40.11 DIDN'T WORK:**

The issue is that v40.11 detects REACTIVE positions (after the attack is set up), but the bot needs to:
1. **NOT PLAY Bxf6** in the first place - don't initiate exchanges that open files toward your king
2. **FORESEE** the pawn storm f5-f4 coming and prepare counter-measures

The v40BadExchangeFileOpeningEval function checks if THIS move opens a file, but Bxf6 doesn't directly open the g-file - it's the RECAPTURE gxf6 that opens it. The function needs to predict opponent's recapture!

**WHAT V40.12 NEEDS:**
1. **PROPHYLACTIC EXCHANGE ANALYSIS** - Don't make captures where opponent's recapture opens dangerous files
2. **EARLY PAWN STORM DETECTION** - When opponent has f-pawn in starting position and attacking pieces, anticipate f5-f4 coming
3. **DONT PLAY H3 WEAKNESSES** - h3 creates "luft" but also creates a hook for opponent's attack
4. **KING SHELTER PRESERVATION** - Don't exchange pieces that are defending the king's shelter
5. **ATTACK TRAJECTORY PREDICTION** - See where pieces are aiming, not just where they are

The current implementation is REACTIVE (sees attack after it happens), we need PROACTIVE (prevent attack setup).
