Now let me look at the latest game analysis more deeply and understand what went wrong:
Action: Based on my analysis of the session history and current state:

**CURRENT VERSION**: v40.11 TRANSCENDENT SUPREME (29,502 lines)

**THE LATEST GAME (French Defense) ANALYSIS:**
```
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5  ← Good, proper d4!
4. Bd3 Bd6 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. Be3 c6 7. Nf3 Na6 
8. Ne5 Nc5 9. O-O Nxd3 10. Qxd3 O-O 
11. Bg5 Qc7 12. Bxf6 gxf6  ← Bad: Gave enemy open g-file!
13. Nf3 Qd7 14. Qd2 Kh8 15. Ne2 Rg8 16. Ng3 Qg4 ← Queen infiltrating!
17. a3 f5 18. b3 f4  ← Pawn storm coming, bot doesn't react
19. c3 fxg3 20. fxg3 Bf5 ← Bishop targeting kingside
21. Ne5 Bxe5 22. dxe5 Be6 ← Knight gone, bishop still attacking
23. h3 Qxg3 ← DISASTER: Qxg3 wins pawn, attack is crushing
24. Rf2 Rg7 25. Kh1 Rag8 26. Re1 Bxh3 ← h3 falls
27. a4 Bxg2+ 28. Kg1 Qh3 29. Rf6 Be4+ 30. Qg5 Rxg5+ 31. Kf2 Rg2+ 32. Kf1 Ra2#
```

**KEY PROBLEMS:**
1. **Bxf6 opening g-file** - The exchange Bxf6 gxf6 opened the g-file directly toward the white king
2. **Passive a3, b3, c3 pawn moves** - While being attacked on the kingside!
3. **h3 creating a target** - The g3-h3 pawn structure was weak
4. **Queen infiltration to g4/g3** - Not stopped
5. **Rooks doubling on g-file** - Complete crushing attack

The v40.11 functions were supposedly implemented but the bot still lost. This means:
1. Either the functions aren't being called correctly
2. Or the evaluation weights aren't strong enough
3. Or there are bugs in the implementation

Let me view the current v40.11 functions to see if they exist and are implemented correctly.
