Now let me find where the v40.11 functions are integrated into the evaluation and add v40.12 there:
Action: $ cd /app && grep -n "kingsidePawnWeaknessScore" "Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | head -5
Observation: 27548:                const kingsidePawnWeaknessScore = v40KingsidePawnWeaknessEval(fen, move, board, activeColor, moveNumber) * 2.0;
27576:                               badExchangeFileScore + pawnStormScore + defendKingsideScore + kingsidePawnWeaknessScore;
27634:                debugLog("[V40_INTEGRATE]", `   🆕 KINGSIDE PAWN WEAKNESS: ${kingsidePawnWeaknessScore.toFixed(1)}`);
Exit code: 0
