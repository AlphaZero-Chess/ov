Now let me update the score calculation to include the v40.39 scores:
Action: file_editor str_replace /app/Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js --old-str "                               // v40.38 GXF3 PROHIBITION & KING DANGER WALK & MATING NET SUPREME additions!
                               gxf3ProhibitionScore + kingDangerWalkScore + forcedMateDefenseScore +
                               pawnMoveUnderAttackScore + passiveQueenUnderMateScore + bishopUselessSquareScore;
                v40Bonus = v40DeepScore * 1.0;  // 100% influence — v40.38 GXF3 PROHIBITION & MATE DEFENSE PARADIGM SHIFT" --new-str "                               // v40.38 GXF3 PROHIBITION & KING DANGER WALK & MATING NET SUPREME additions!
                               gxf3ProhibitionScore + kingDangerWalkScore + forcedMateDefenseScore +
                               pawnMoveUnderAttackScore + passiveQueenUnderMateScore + bishopUselessSquareScore +
                               // v40.39 PAWN CAPTURE CHAIN SUPREME additions — THE ULTIMATE TACTICAL FIX!
                               pawnCaptureChainScore + pieceUnderPawnAttackScore + promotionThreatV39Score +
                               recaptureChainScore + pieceUnderPawnDangerScore + pawnForkDetectionScore;
                v40Bonus = v40DeepScore * 1.0;  // 100% influence — v40.39 PAWN CAPTURE CHAIN SUPREME PARADIGM SHIFT"
