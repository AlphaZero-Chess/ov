Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the codebase. Let me analyze the most recent game and create a v40.39 implementation to fix the critical issues:
Action: Looking at the most recent game from the user's problem statement:

[White "AlphaZero"]
[Black "lichess AI level 8"]
1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Bb5 g6 5. d4 cxd4 6. e5 dxc3 7. exf6 cxb2 
8. Bxb2 Qa5+ 9. Kf1 Qxb5+ 10. c4 Qxb2 11. fxe7 Bg7 12. Rc1 Qxa2 13. Qd6 Bb2 
14. Kg1 Bxc1 15. Qd5 Ba3 16. Nd2 Qa1+ 17. Nf1 Bxe7 18. Qf3 Qc1 19. Qd3 d6 
20. Qd2 Qxd2 21. Nxd2 Be6 22. c5 dxc5 23. f3 O-O-O 24. Nf1 Rd1 25. Kf2 b5 
26. Ke3 Nd4 27. g3 Re1+ 28. Kd3 c4+ 29. Kc3 b4+ 30. Kxd4 Rd8# 0-1

CRITICAL ISSUES (playing as White):

1. Move 6: After 5...cxd4, White played 6.e5 - This is terrible because:
   - The knight on c3 is attacked by the pawn on d4
   - cxd4 creates the threat cxc3
   - White should have recaptured on d4!

2. Move 7: After 6...dxc3, White played 7.exf6 - CATASTROPHIC!
   - The pawn on c3 now attacks the bishop on b5 AND threatens b2 promotion!
   - White lost a whole piece (knight) and is losing more

3. Move 7-8: cxb2 then Bxb2 - White is down massive material

The core problem is:
- PAWN CAPTURE ON PIECE DETECTION - when a pawn captures a piece (cxd4 captures space near Nc3), the response must address the captured material or recapture
- PAWN ATTACK CHAIN - dxc3 attacks Bb5 AND threatens b2

I need to implement v40.39 with:
1. PAWN CAPTURE RESPONSE - When opponent pawn takes a pawn, see if it attacks pieces
2. PAWN CHAIN THREAT - When pawn can capture AND promote/fork, must stop it
3. CAPTURE SEQUENCE CHAIN - See chains of captures 3+ moves deep
4. PIECE UNDER PAWN ATTACK - Must respond when piece is attacked by pawn
5. PROMOTION THREAT DETECTION - See when pawn can promote after captures

This is a FUNDAMENTAL tactical oversight - the bot doesn't see pawn attack chains properly.
