Good, syntax is valid. Now let me analyze the NEW game that was lost more thoroughly:
Action: Analyzing the NEW lost game:
[White "AlphaZero"]
[Black "lichess AI level 8"]
[Result "0-1"]
[ECO "C20"]
[Opening "King's Pawn Game: Leonardis Variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. d3 (PASSIVE! Should play d4, Nf3, or Nc3)
2...Nc6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Be2 d5 5. exd5 Nxd5 
6. O-O Bd6 7. c4 Nde7 (Knight retreats, giving tempo)
8. Be3 Nf5 9. Nc3 O-O 10. Ne4 Be7 
11. Bd2 f6 12. Bc3 Qd7 13. Kh1 b6 
14. Qb3 Bb7 15. Ng3 Nxg3+ (Knight trades, opening h-file)
16. Kg1 Nxe2+ (Discovered check! Knight takes bishop with check)
17. Kh1 Ncd4 (Knight invades on d4)
18. Bxd4 Bxf3 (Bishop takes knight, wins material)
19. gxf3 Qc6 (Queen targets f3)
20. Rg1 Qxf3+ (Wins pawn with check)
21. Rg2 Nf4 (Knight threatens Rg2)
22. Rg1 exd4 (Takes pawn, winning more material)
23. Qd1 Qxd1 (Queens trade, but Black is winning)
24. a3 Qf3 25. c5 Nxd3 (Knight takes pawn, devastating)
26. Re1 Nxe1 27. c6 Qxg2# (MATE by queen on g2)

KEY MISTAKES BY THE BOT:
1. Move 2: d3 is passive - should play d4, Nf3, or Nc3 for e4 openings
2. Move 15: Allowed Nxg3+ which led to discovered check tactic
3. Move 16: Didn't see Nxe2+ discovered check winning the bishop
4. Move 18: After Bxd4, allowed Bxf3 winning more material
5. Move 20: gxf3 - pawn recapture created weak g-file
6. Overall: Failed to see the tactical sequence starting with Nxg3+

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. OPENING THEORY - d3 is too passive in e4 openings
2. DISCOVERED ATTACK DETECTION - Failed to see Nxg3+ → Nxe2+ combo
3. KNIGHT INVASION PENALTY - Allowed knight penetration on g3, f5, d4, d3
4. WEAK SQUARE DETECTION - g3, f3, g2 became critical weaknesses
5. TACTICAL HORIZON - Didn't see the 2-move tactical sequence
6. QUEEN MATING PATTERN - Qxg2# wasn't anticipated

ENHANCEMENTS NEEDED FOR v40.4:
1. Opening book or opening principles enforcement
2. Stronger discovered attack/check detection
3. Knight invasion penalties (enemy knights on 3rd-6th rank in our territory)
4. Weak square complex detection
5. Pawn shield integrity evaluation
6. Enhanced queen mating pattern detection
7. Tactical depth increase for forcing sequences
