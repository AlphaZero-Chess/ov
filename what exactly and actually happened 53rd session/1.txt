Now I have a clear picture of what was done in session 52. The main finding was that v40.33 functions were declared but NOT integrated into the v40DeepScore calculation. The session fixed that integration. Let me now analyze the latest game provided by the user:
Action: Based on my review of session 52 and the problem statement:

**Current State (v40.34):**
- The v40.33 functions (absoluteD3ProhibitionScore, sicilianMasteryScore, etc.) were finally integrated into the computeCombinedScore
- d2d3 was added to the OPENING_BLACKLIST weakening category with beforeMove: 40
- Hard move filter rejects d2d3 in first 10 moves
- Queen retreat filter exists

**Latest Game Analysis (Petrov's Defense - C42):**
```
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 Nxe4 (Petrov's Defense: Damiano Variation)
4. d4 d5 5. Bd3 Nd7 6. O-O Nxe5 7. dxe5 Nc5 8. Be3 Be7 
9. Be2 O-O 10. Nc3 c6 11. Bg4 a5 12. Bf3 Nd7 13. Qd4 Bc5 
14. Qf4 Bxe3 15. Qxe3 Re8 16. Qf4 Qe7 17. a3 Qxe5
...
34. Qxf4# Black wins by checkmate
```

**Critical Issues I see:**
1. **Move 17: a3** - This is a PASSIVE pawn move that wastes time! This is in the blacklist but apparently not enforced
2. **Material Loss**: White gave away the e5 pawn (17...Qxe5)
3. **Positional Collapse**: The bot couldn't hold the position and got mated

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The bot is still losing because:
1. It makes passive moves like a3
2. It doesn't maintain piece safety
3. It allows tactical combinations
4. It doesn't properly evaluate threats

**What needs to be done in THIS session (53rd):**
1. Review and strengthen the current implementation
2. Analyze why a3 was played despite being in the blacklist
3. Add more robust tactical verification
4. Enhance the MCTS simulation to catch these blunders

Let me first view the current state of the file to understand what the 52nd session left off with and then continue enhancing the bot.
