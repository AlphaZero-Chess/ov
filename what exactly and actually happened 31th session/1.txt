Now I can see the evaluation integration. The v40.20 functions were added but NOT YET INTEGRATED into the main evaluation loop. Let me continue from where session 30 left off and integrate the v40.20 functions:
Action: Based on my analysis of the 30th session files and the current state of the codebase:

1. Session 30 analyzed the game where AlphaZero lost
2. The key issues identified were:
   - Move 18 (Qc1) - passive queen
   - Move 19 (Bd3) - bishop attacked by c4
   - Move 20 (f3) - weakening kingside
   - Move 21 (g3) - disaster allowing promotion
   - Move 22 (gxh4) - allows cxb1=R promotion

3. v40.20 CONFIG parameters were added
4. v40.20 functions were added:
   - v40PromotionThreatEval
   - v40ForcingSequenceEval
   - v40KingWeakeningPenaltyEval
   - v40PieceSafetyAbsoluteEval

5. But the functions were NOT YET INTEGRATED into the main evaluation loop (line ~31990-32100)

My plan for session continuation (session 30 continuation):
1. First check if v40.20 functions exist in the file
2. Integrate v40.20 functions into the main evaluation at line 31998-32046
3. Add debugging logs for v40.20
4. Update the version header to reflect v40.20
5. Verify syntax
6. Test if bot loads without errors

Let me implement these steps now.
Observation: Your thought has been logged.
