Syntax is now correct. Now let me check the current version number and see what functions need to be completed or enhanced based on the 75th session plans:
Action: Based on my analysis of the session files and current codebase:

1. Current state: v40.52 SUPREME TACTICAL VISION
2. Line count: ~50,083 lines (now ~50,070 after fix)
3. The v40.52 functions are implemented and integrated:
   - v40AntiPassiveOpeningEnforcement
   - v40DeepMatingThreatScanner
   - v40ImmediateDangerResponse
   - v40KingActivityMaximizer
   - v40TempoCriticalEval
   - v40CrushingExchangeEval
   
4. From the 75th session notes, the plan was to "add these two new functions to the computeCombinedScore integration" - which is already done.

5. The bot is still losing games as shown in the problem statement. The most recent games show:
   - Bot loses in ~30 moves consistently
   - Passive opening play (d3 instead of d4)
   - Getting mated in corners/back rank
   - Missing tactical threats
   - Poor endgame technique

The user wants to continue enhancing the bot to be a TRUE AlphaZero replica that can beat Lichess AI level 8.

Key improvements needed based on game analysis:
1. The v40.52 functions exist but may not have strong enough weights
2. Need to add more endgame-specific logic
3. Need stronger checkmate prevention
4. Need to ensure opening principles are enforced

The user mentioned continuing the plans from 75th session. Let me review what was planned and implement the next enhancements.

Looking at the problem statement, the user wants:
- "HIGHEST PRIORITY Note: Bruteforce to not use up so much credits and to save up alot and time"
- Continue the plans about "Now let me add these two new functions to the computeCombinedScore integration"

The functions are already integrated. Now I should:
1. Verify all v40.52 functions work correctly
2. Add any missing helper functions
3. Potentially increase the weight of the anti-passive and mating threat scanners
4. Update the version to v40.53 with further enhancements

Let me check if there are any incomplete/missing helper functions referenced by the v40.52 functions.
Observation: Your thought has been logged.
