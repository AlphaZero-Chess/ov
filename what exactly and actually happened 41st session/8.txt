Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the codebase. The file is currently at v40.27 header but we need to continue implementing the v40.27 functions. Let me check where the v40.26 helper functions end and add the v40.27 functions:
Action: $ grep -n "// v40.26 HELPER\|function v40CreatesKingsideWeakness\|function v40CountKingsidePawns\|function v40IsFileOpenToward" "/app/Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | head -20
Observation: 20861:// v40.26 HELPER FUNCTIONS
21132:function v40CountKingsidePawns(board, color) {
21146:function v40IsFileOpenToward(board, fileChar, kingSquare, ourColor) {
21162:function v40CreatesKingsideWeakness(move, boardBefore, boardAfter, ourColor) {
Exit code: 0
