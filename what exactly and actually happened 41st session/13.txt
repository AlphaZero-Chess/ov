Now I need to integrate the v40.27 functions into the computeCombinedScore. Let me find where the v40.26 scores are integrated:
Action: $ grep -n "kingsideCollapseScore\|v40.26: COMBINED\|v40.26 ABSOLUTE KINGSIDE\|// v40.26:" "/app/Lichess Bot-AlphaZero-Pure.user.js" | head -20
Observation: 1964:    // v40.26: ABSOLUTE KINGSIDE FORTRESS SUPREME — THE FINAL DEFENSE
1970:    // v40.26: ABSOLUTE G3/F3/H3 PROHIBITION — NEVER weaken when threatened!
1979:    // v40.26: BISHOP SACRIFICE DETECTION — See Bxg3/Bxh2 sacrifices BEFORE they happen!
1987:    // v40.26: FORCED DEFENSE MODE — When under kingside attack, ONLY defensive moves!
1995:    // v40.26: QUEEN ON H5/G5/H4/G4 DETECTION — Attack is IMMINENT!
2004:    // v40.26: DEEP SACRIFICE CALCULATION — Calculate forcing lines after sacrifice!
2012:    // v40.26: KINGSIDE COLLAPSE PATTERN — Recognize when shelter is being destroyed!
2021:    // v40.26: 100% ABSOLUTE KINGSIDE FORTRESS SUPREME DOMINANCE

37258:                               // v40.26 ABSOLUTE KINGSIDE FORTRESS SUPREME additions:
37260:                               queenKingsideThreatScore + deepSacrificeCalcScore + kingsideCollapseScore;
