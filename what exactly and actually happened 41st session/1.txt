
Action: Based on my review of sessions 8-10, I can see the progression:
- Session 8: Started v40.3 enhancements with anti-passivity, deep horizon, space domination
- Session 9: Continued v40.3, enhanced space domination, added territory depth calculation
- Session 10: Started v40.4 with discovered attack detection, knight invasion penalties, opening principles, queen mating patterns, pawn shield integrity

Now I need to continue from where session 10 left off. Let me check what happened in later sessions (11-39) to understand the current state before implementing the 40th session improvements.

The user mentioned we're at the 40th session and should continue the plan about "Now let me add the v40.27 functions. Let me find a good location to add the v40.27 functions. Let me search for where the v40.26 helper functions end"

This suggests significant progress has been made through sessions 11-39, and we need to find where v40.26/v40.27 functions are.

Let me check the current state of the file to understand what version we're at and what functions exist.
