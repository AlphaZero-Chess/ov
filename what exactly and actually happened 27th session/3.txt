
Action: Based on my analysis:

CURRENT STATE:
- File is at v40.15 PIECE PRESERVATION SUPREME 
- ~31,770 lines
- Session 26 implemented:
  - v40.15 CONFIG values (piece preservation penalties, defense bonuses)
  - v40PiecePreservationEval function
  - v40AllPiecesSafetyCheck function
  - v40ProphylaxisMoveEval function
  - Integration into v40DeepScore
  - Debug logging updates

LATEST GAME ANALYSIS (from user's message):
Game: French Defense Exchange Variation
Bot lost: 0-1
Key issues from analyzing the game:
1. Move 5. Nc3 - Move 14: Bot played reasonably
2. Move 12. Bxf6 gxf6 - BAD! Opens g-file toward king (this was the v40.12 fix target)
3. Move 16. Ne2?? - Terrible! Allowed Nxg3+!
4. Move 19. f3 f4! - Allowed pawn storm  
5. Move 23. Qxg3?? - Blunder allowing queen infiltration
6. Move 27. Bxg2+! - Fork, winning exchange
7. CHECKMATE at move 32

The bot is STILL:
1. Making tactical blunders (Nxg3+, Qxg3)
2. Not defending against kingside attacks
3. Missing forcing tactical sequences

For this session (27th), I need to analyze WHY v40.15 didn't prevent these issues and implement v40.16 improvements.

Looking at the game:
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 4. Bd3 Bd6 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. Be3 c6 7. Nf3 Na6 8. Ne5 Nc5 
9. O-O Nxd3 10. Qxd3 O-O 11. Bg5 Qc7 12. Bxf6 gxf6 13. Nf3 Qd7 14. Qd2 Kh8 
15. Ne2 Rg8 16. Ng3 Qg4 (threatening Qxg3!) 17. a3 f5 18. b3 f4 19. c3 fxg3 
20. fxg3 Bf5 21. Ne5 Bxe5 22. dxe5 Be6 23. h3 Qxg3 (Queen infiltrates!) 
24. Rf2 Rg7 25. Kh1 Rag8 26. Re1 Bxh3 27. a4 Bxg2+ 28. Kg1 Qh3 
29. Rf6 Be4+ 30. Qg5 Rxg5+ 31. Kf2 Rg2+ 32. Kf1 Ra2# { Checkmate }

Key problems:
1. Move 12. Bxf6?? - Opened g-file toward own king! This is v40.12 target but didn't work
2. Move 16. Ng3?? - Placed knight where it can be captured with Qxg3
3. Move 19. c3?? - Allowed fxg3 opening the f-file AND g-file toward king
4. Move 23. h3?? - Allowed Qxg3 queen infiltration

The bot is STILL making these mistakes because:
1. Evaluation functions exist but aren't being PROPERLY WEIGHTED
2. The look-ahead is not deep enough
3. The functions don't consider LONG-TERM consequences (e.g., opening files toward king)

For v40.16, I need to implement:
1. DEEPER look-ahead (simulate 3-4 moves ahead, not just 1-2)
2. FILE OPENING AWARENESS - Never open files toward own king
3. STRONGER KING SAFETY CORRIDOR - Don't allow any pieces/pawns near king to be captured
4. PAWN STRUCTURE WEAKNESS DETECTION - f4xg3 type weaknesses
5. FORCING SEQUENCE DETECTION - Detect Qg4-Qxg3-Qh3 type attacks

Let me continue the implementation by:
1. First checking syntax of current file
2. Then implementing v40.16 DEEPER LOOK-AHEAD SUPREME
