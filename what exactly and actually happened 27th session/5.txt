File syntax is valid. Now let me analyze the latest game in detail to identify what v40.16 needs to fix:
Action: Analyzing the latest game in detail:

Game: French Defense Exchange Variation (Bot as White, lost 0-1)

Critical Blunders:
1. Move 12. Bxf6 gxf6 - OPENED G-FILE TOWARD OWN CASTLED KING!
   - This is exactly what v40.12 was supposed to prevent
   - Bot should NEVER exchange on f6 when king is castled kingside
   
2. Move 16. Ng3?? - Put knight on g3 which can be taken
   - After f5, f4 attack, knight on g3 is vulnerable
   - Bot should see that pawn storm f5-f4 threatens the knight
   
3. Move 19. c3?? - Allowed fxg3 
   - After fxg3, White's kingside is DESTROYED
   - Bot should have played something defensive
   
4. Move 23. h3?? - Allowed Qxg3
   - Queen infiltrates with devastating effect
   - Bot missed that h3 doesn't defend anything

THE ROOT CAUSE:
The bot has all these evaluation functions but they're not working because:
1. Functions return penalties BUT the total score is dominated by other factors
2. The WEIGHTS on critical functions are too low
3. There's no TRUE LOOK-AHEAD that simulates opponent's best response to OUR response

What v40.16 needs:
1. CATASTROPHIC KINGSIDE WEAKNESS DETECTION
   - If pawns in front of castled king can be captured/advanced against = HUGE penalty
   - If g-file can be opened toward our castled king = MASSIVE penalty
   
2. DEEP FORCING LINE DETECTION
   - Detect f5-f4-fxg3 type pawn storms BEFORE they happen
   - Detect Qg4-Qxg3-Qh3 type queen infiltration paths
   
3. ABSOLUTE FILE OPENING PENALTY
   - Never allow opponent to open files toward our king
   - Bxf6 gxf6 opens g-file = REJECT this move entirely
   
4. 3-PLY MINIMUM LOOK-AHEAD
   - For EVERY move, simulate: We play -> Opponent responds -> We respond
   - If at any point we're worse by >300cp = consider move dangerous

Let me implement v40.16 CATASTROPHIC KINGSIDE DEFENSE SUPREME
